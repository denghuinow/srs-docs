Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Purpose\nThis document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the High Assurance Transformation System (HATS) Graphical User Interface (GUI). The purpose of this software is to provide a platform-independent, user-friendly interface that simplifies interaction with the transformation-based software development tools of the HATS system. This SRS is intended for the project managers, developers, and testers involved in the implementation and verification of the HATS GUI.\n\n### 1.2 Project Scope\nThe HATS GUI will be a standalone application that acts as a front-end to the HATS transformation engine (HATS-SML). It will allow users to manage transformation projects, visualize code structures as Syntax Derivation Trees (SDTs), execute transformation programs, and view the results. The core value is abstracting the command-line complexity of HATS-SML into an intuitive graphical environment, thereby increasing productivity and reducing the learning curve for new users.\n\n### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations\n\n| Term | Definition |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **HATS** | High Assurance Transformation System. |\n| **GUI** | Graphical User Interface. |\n| **SDT** | Syntax Derivation Tree. A hierarchical tree structure representing the syntactic structure of source code. |\n| **HATS-SML** | The underlying transformation language and engine for the HATS system. |\n| **MVP** | Minimum Viable Product. The set of features required for the first functional release. |\n| **Transformation Program** | A program written in the HATS transformation language that defines code modifications. |\n| **Target File** | A source code file upon which a transformation program is executed. |\n\n### 1.4 References\n*   HATS System Overview, Internal Document v1.5\n*   HATS-SML Language Specification, Version 1.8\n*   Java 2 Platform Specification (J2SE)\n\n### 1.5 Overview\nThe remainder of this document is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overall description of the product, including its perspective, functions, and constraints.

This interface is designed to facilitate robust and efficient communication between software models and Hardware Designs Under Test (DUTs) within emulation and verification environments. The intended audience for this document includes software architects, verification engineers, RTL developers, and project managers.\n\n### 1.2 Project Scope\nThe product is a software library that provides a standardized modeling interface. Its primary goal is to bridge the gap between untimed or loosely-timed software models (e.g., written in C/C++ or SystemC) and cycle-accurate hardware DUTs (e.g., RTL or gate-level simulations running on emulators). It enables transaction-level communication, abstracting away the underlying transport mechanism and synchronization complexities.\n\n### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations\n*   **API**: Application Programming Interface\n*   **DUT**: Design Under Test. The hardware design being verified.\n*   **RTL**: Register-Transfer Level.

It is not a standalone application but a library to be integrated into a larger verification environment.\n\n```\n+-------------------------------------+\n|         Software Model(s)           |\n|  (C/C++, SystemC, Untimed/Timed)    |\n+------------------+------------------+\n                   | C/C++ API (This Product)\n+------------------v------------------+\n|     Standard Modeling Interface     |\n|  - Message Channels                 |\n|  - Clock Control & Sync            |\n|  - Service Loop                    |\n+------------------+------------------+\n                   | Platform-Specific Transport\n+------------------v------------------+\n|      Hardware DUT (RTL/Gate)        |\n|        on Emulator/Simulator        |\n+-------------------------------------+\n```\n\n### 2.2 Product Functions\nThe core functions of the Standard Modeling Interface are:\n1.  Establish and manage multiple, independent communication channels.\n2.  Transfer messages (transactions) between software and hardware domains.\n3.  Synchronize untimed software models with a timed hardware simulation.\n4.  Provide control mechanisms to pause the DUT's clock during transactor operations to prevent data loss.\n5.  Expose a clean, consistent API in both C++ and C.\n\n### 2.3 User Characteristics\nThe primary users are **Verification Engineers** and **Software Model Developers** who are proficient in C/C++ and have a working understanding of hardware verification methodologies. They are expected to integrate this library into their testbenches and models.\n\n### 2.4 Constraints\n1.  **Accuracy Constraint**: The interface is not intended for event-based or sub-cycle accurate simulation bridging. It operates optimally at the transaction or cycle level.\n2.  **Compatibility Constraint**: The design must be optimized for seamless integration with SystemC-based models and testbenches.\n3.  **Operational Constraint**: The software model must frequently call a specific service loop function to ensure timely sending and receiving of messages.\n\n### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies\n*   **Assumption**: The underlying emulation or verification platform provides a reliable, low-latency transport layer (e.g., PCIe, TCP sockets) for data exchange.\n*   **Dependency**: The product's performance is dependent on the efficiency of the host's C/C++ compiler and standard library.\n*   **Assumption**: The hardware DUT interface includes a mechanism for clock gating or pausing, which can be controlled by the modeling interface.\n\n## 3 System Features and Requirements\n\n### 3.1 Multiple Message Channels\n**Description:** The system shall provide the capability to create and manage multiple, logically independent message channels.\n\n**Requirements:**\n*   **FR-1.1:** The API shall allow a user to create a channel with a unique identifier.\n*   **FR-1.2:** The API shall allow a user to destroy a previously created channel.\n*   **FR-1.3:** Channels shall be non-blocking; a send or receive operation on one channel shall not block operations on other channels.\n*   **FR-1.4:** The system shall support a configurable depth for each channel's message queue.\n\n### 3.2 Untimed Model Support\n**Description:** The system shall enable software models that are untimed (not bound to a simulation clock) to communicate effectively with a timed hardware DUT.\n\n**Requirements:**\n*   **FR-2.1:** The interface shall abstract the underlying timing of the hardware DUT from the software model.\n*   **FR-2.2:** The software model shall be able to send a message to the DUT without specifying a simulation time.\n\n### 3.3 Clock Control for DUT Time Freezing\n**Description:** The system shall include a mechanism to pause (freeze) the DUT's simulation time to allow transactor operations to complete without advancing the DUT state.\n\n**Requirements:**\n*   **FR-3.1:** The API shall provide a function to request the DUT's clock to be paused.\n*   **FR-3.2:** The API shall provide a function to request the DUT's clock to be resumed.\n*   **FR-3.3:** The clock pause/resume mechanism shall be managed automatically during message transmission and reception to ensure data integrity.\n\n### 3.4 Dual C++ and C API Support\n**Description:** The software-side access shall be provided through two APIs: a native C++ API and a pure C API.\n\n**Requirements:**\n*   **FR-4.1:** A C++ API shall be provided, leveraging features like classes, namespaces, and templates for ease of use and type safety.\n*   **FR-4.2:** A pure C API shall be provided, with a `extern \"C\"` interface, for compatibility with C codebases and other programming languages.\n*   **FR-4.3:** The functional capabilities of the C and C++ APIs shall be equivalent.\n\n**Example C++ API Snippet:**\n```cpp\nnamespace modeling_interface {\n    class channel {\n    public:\n        channel(const std::string& name);\n        bool send(const void* data, size_t size);\n        bool receive(void* buffer, size_t& size_received);\n    };\n    void service_loop();\n}\n```\n\n**Example C API Snippet:**\n```c\ntypedef struct modeling_interface_channel modeling_interface_channel_t;\n\nmodeling_interface_channel_t* modeling_interface_channel_create(const char* name);\nbool modeling_interface_channel_send(modeling_interface_channel_t* chan, const void* data, size_t size);\nbool modeling_interface_channel_receive(modeling_interface_channel_t* chan, void* buffer, size_t* size_received);\nvoid modeling_interface_service_loop(void);\n```\n\n### 3.5 Service Loop Processing\n**Description:** The system relies on a cooperative scheduling model where the user's software thread must periodically yield to the library for background processing.\n\n**Requirements:**\n*   **FR-5.1:** The API shall provide a `service_loop()` (or equivalent) function.\n*   **FR-5.2:** The `service_loop()` function shall be non-blocking and must be called frequently by the user's application to process incoming and outgoing messages.\n*   **FR-5.3:** The documentation shall explicitly state that failure to call the service loop regularly will result in communication stalls.\n\n## 4 External Interface Requirements\n\n### 4.1 User Interfaces\nThere is no graphical user interface. The user interface is entirely programmatic via the C and C++ APIs.\n\n### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces\nThe interface communicates with the hardware DUT via a platform-specific transport layer (e.g., an emulator's proprietary API, TLM interfaces in a simulator). The library will contain hardware abstraction layers (HAL) for supported platforms.\n\n### 4.3 Software Interfaces\n*   **SystemC**: The C++ API shall be designed for natural integration with SystemC modules and threads.\n*   **C/C++ Standard Library**: The implementation will use standard containers and utilities.\n\n### 4.4 Communication Interfaces\nThe primary communication is transaction-based message passing over the established channels. The physical transport is abstracted but is assumed to be a high-speed link like PCIe for emulation or inter-process communication for co-simulation.\n\n## 5 Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 5.1 Performance Requirements\n*   **PERF-1:** The latency for a round-trip message (software->hardware->software) shall be minimized and documented for each supported platform.\n*   **PERF-2:** The library's internal overhead shall have a minimal impact on the simulation performance of the DUT.\n\n### 5.2 Reliability Requirements\n*   **REL-1:** The library shall be resilient to message queue overflow.

The purpose of this system is to enable distinct and autonomous Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to dynamically coordinate and cooperate through peering arrangements. This coordination aims to provide a virtualized, scalable, and reliable content delivery service that surpasses the capacity of any single participating CDN, especially under exceptional load conditions.\n\nThis SRS is intended to be used by the project managers, developers, testers, and system architects involved in the implementation and verification of the CPCS.\n\n### 1.2 Document Conventions\n- Requirements are specified using the structure outlined in this document.\n- Key terms are **bolded** upon first use.\n- Technical terms and names of system components are written in `code font`.\n\n### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions\n- **Project Managers:** Should focus on Section 1 (Introduction) and Section 2 (Overall Description) to understand scope and constraints.\n- **System Architects & Developers:** Should read the entire document, with emphasis on Section 2 (Overall Description), Section 3 (System Features), and Section 5 (Non-Functional Requirements).\n- **QA Testers:** Should use Section 3 (System Features) and Section 5 (Non-Functional Requirements) to derive test cases.\n\n### 1.4 Project Scope\nThe CPCS is a middleware software solution that operates across the infrastructure of multiple, independent CDNs. It does not replace existing CDN components but augments them with peering intelligence. The core value is achieved by dynamically forming peering relationships to offload traffic during **hotspot** events (e.g., flash crowds, viral content), thereby maintaining service quality and adhering to **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**.\n\nOut of scope for this MVP is the management of the underlying CDN caches, the direct serving of content to end-users, and the billing/accounting between peered CDNs.\n\n### 1.5 References\n*Not provided in the input. To be populated by the development team.*\n- [1] IEEE Std. 830-1998 - IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.\n\n## 2 Overall Description\n\n### 2.1 Product Perspective\nThe CPCS is a decentralized system that interfaces with the existing components of participating CDNs. It acts as an overlay network that facilitates communication and agreement between otherwise competing or separate entities. The system virtualizes the combined resources of peered CDNs, presenting them as a unified delivery platform to the internal logic of each member CDN.\n\n### 2.2 Product Functions\nThe high-level functions of the CPCS are:\n1.  **Hotspot Detection:** Monitor internal CDN servers for signs of exceptional load.\n2.  **Peering Initiation:** Automatically trigger a request for external assistance when a hotspot is detected.\n3.  **Requirement Negotiation:** Define the service needs (e.g., bandwidth, geographic region) and negotiate terms with potential peer CDNs.\n4.  **Peer Discovery:** Identify and evaluate suitable peer CDNs that can fulfill the service requirements.\n5.  **Peering Establishment:** Form a secure, temporary peering arrangement between CDNs.\n6.  **Request Redirection:** Seamlessly redirect user requests from an overloaded CDN to a peer CDN.\n7.  **Policy Enforcement:** Ensure all peering activities comply with predefined business and security policies.\n\n### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics\nThe CPCS is primarily an automated system. The main \"users\" are other systems and CDN administrators:\n- **CDN Operator/Administrator:** Configures policies, monitors the peering system, and handles exceptional cases. Has expert knowledge of CDN operations.\n- **Mediator Component:** An automated system actor that handles negotiation. It operates based on predefined rules and SLAs.\n- **Peering Agent Component:** An automated system actor that handles discovery and establishment. It interacts with external CDN agents.\n\n### 2.4 Operating Environment\n- **Software:** The system components (`Web Servers`, `Mediators`, `Peering Agents`) will be deployed on modern Linux distributions. They will interact with existing CDN orchestration and load-balancing systems.\n- **Network:** Requires secure, low-latency communication channels (e.g., VPNs, TLS) between the `Peering Agents` of different CDNs.\n- **Hardware:** Must be capable of running on standard server hardware within a data center environment.\n\n### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints\n1.  **Information Sharing Limitation:** The system must function effectively while sharing minimal proprietary operational data (e.g., exact cache contents, detailed network topology) between peered CDNs.\n2.  **Heuristic-Based Implementation:** Dynamic attributes such as server load and network delay cannot be measured with perfect accuracy across CDN boundaries. The system must rely on **heuristics** and estimates for decision-making.\n3.  **Multi-Tenancy and SLA Preservation:** The system must virtualize multiple CDN providers while strictly preserving the individual SLA commitments each provider has with its customers. Redirection logic must be cognizant of performance guarantees.\n\n### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies\n- **Assumption:** Participating CDNs have a pre-established business relationship and a base level of trust.\n- **Assumption:** A secure communication infrastructure (e.g., PKI for authentication) is available between CDNs.\n- **Dependency:** The system depends on the existing CDN's load balancers and DNS to implement the final request redirection decisions.\n\n## 3 System Features\nThis section details the functional requirements for each major component.\n\n### 3.1 Hotspot Detection and Peering Initiation\n**Description:** The `Web Server` components (or associated monitors) within a CDN must be able to identify a traffic hotspot and formally request peering assistance.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- **FR-1:** The system shall monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as requests per second, CPU load, and network egress bandwidth on designated `Web Servers`.\n- **FR-2:** The system shall allow administrators to define thresholds for each KPI that constitute a \"hotspot\" condition.\n- **FR-3:** Upon detecting that KPIs have exceeded defined thresholds for a sustained period (configurable), the system shall automatically generate a `Peering Request`.\n- **FR-4:** A `Peering Request` shall include, at a minimum: requested content ID, required bandwidth, geographic scope of the hotspot, and desired duration.\n\n### 3.2 Service Requirement Generation and Negotiation\n**Description:** The `Mediator` component translates a `Peering Request` into formal `Service Requirements` and negotiates with other CDNs.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- **FR-5:** The `Mediator` shall generate a `Service Requirement` document from a `Peering Request`, incorporating business rules and SLA constraints.\n- **FR-6:** The `Mediator` shall communicate the `Service Requirement` to its local `Peering Agent` for discovery.\n- **FR-7:** Upon receiving a list of potential peers from the `Peering Agent`, the `Mediator` shall initiate a negotiation protocol with the `Mediators` of the candidate CDNs.\n- **FR-8:** The negotiation protocol shall be able to handle offers, counter-offers, and final agreement on terms, all within a time-constrained window.\n\n### 3.3 External Resource Discovery and Peering Establishment\n**Description:** The `Peering Agent` is responsible for discovering which external CDNs can meet the `Service Requirements` and for technically establishing the peering session.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- **FR-9:** The `Peering Agent` shall maintain a dynamic registry of potential peer CDNs and their high-level capabilities (e.g., geographic presence, general capacity).\n- **FR-10:** The `Peering Agent` shall broadcast or query for CDNs that can fulfill a given `Service Requirement`.\n- **FR-11:** The `Peering Agent` shall use **heuristics** to rank potential peers based on estimated network latency and current willingness to accept new peering requests.\n- **FR-12:** Upon receiving a negotiation confirmation from the `Mediator`, the `Peering Agent` shall establish a secure peering session with the peer's `Peering Agent`, including the exchange of necessary routing/redirection information.\n\n### 3.4 Operational Management and Policy Enforcement\n**Description:** This encompasses the ongoing management of active peering sessions, including content delivery, request redirection, and adherence to policies.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- **FR-13:** The system shall redirect client requests for specific content to a peered CDN once a peering session is active.\n- **FR-14:** The system shall enforce all configured policies during the peering lifecycle, including security policies (e.g., allowed content types) and business policies (e.g., maximum cost for peering).\n- **FR-15:** The system shall monitor the health and performance of active peering sessions.\n- **FR-16:** The system shall gracefully terminate a peering session upon expiration of its term, fulfillment of its purpose, or violation of policy/SLA.\n\n## 4 External Interface Requirements\n\n### 4.1 User Interfaces\n- **Web-based Dashboard:** A secure web interface for CDN administrators to configure policies, view active peering sessions, and monitor system health.\n\n### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces\nThe software will run on standard server hardware. No specific hardware interfaces are defined.\n\n### 4.3 Software Interfaces\n- **Local CDN Load Balancer API:** The CPCS must integrate with the local CDN's load balancer (e.g., via API) to inject rules for redirecting requests to peer CDNs.\n- **Local Monitoring System:** Must interface with existing monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Nagios) to obtain KPI data for hotspot detection.\n\n### 4.4 Communications Interfaces\n- **Inter-CDN Communication:** All communication between `Peering Agents` and `Mediators` of different CDNs shall be over secure channels using TLS 1.3 or higher.\n- **Message Format:** Internal and external messages shall be formatted in JSON or Protocol Buffers for efficiency and interoperability.\n\n## 5 Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 5.1 Performance Requirements\n- The system must detect a hotspot and initiate the peering process within 30 seconds of threshold breach.\n- The negotiation protocol between `Mediators` must complete within a 60-second timeout period.\n- The act of request redirection must not add more than 100ms of latency to the end-user request.\n\n### 5.2 Reliability Requirements\n- The system must achieve 99.9% uptime for its core coordination components (`Mediator`, `Peering Agent`).\n- A failure in the CPCS must not disrupt the core content delivery functionality of the native CDN; it must fail-safe.\n\n### 5.3 Security Requirements\n- All sensitive data exchanged between CDNs (e.g., keys, policies) must be encrypted.\n- The system must authenticate all entities (CDNs) before engaging in peering activities.\n- The system must be auditable, logging all peering requests, negotiations, and established sessions.\n\n### 5.4 Scalability Requirements\n- The system must be designed to handle peering coordination between at least 10 distinct CDNs simultaneously.\n- The `Peering Agent` must be able to manage discovery and session state for up to 100 concurrent peering arrangements.\n\n### 5.5 Maintainability Requirements\n- The system shall be modular, allowing for the independent update of the `Web Server` monitor, `Mediator`, and `Peering Agent` components.\n- All configuration shall be externalized in human-readable files (e.g., YAML, JSON).\n\n---\n***End of Document***",

Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Purpose\nThis document provides a detailed description of the Software Requirements Specification for GParted (GNOME Partition Editor), Version 1.0. It is intended for stakeholders, including developers, testers, project managers, and end-users, to serve as a definitive guide for the system's functionality, constraints, and operational environment. This SRS will be used as the basis for development, testing, and project validation.\n\n### 1.2 Project Scope\nGParted is a free and open-source graphical partition editor. It enables users to perform data management operations on disk partitions without the need for installation by running from a LiveCD or other bootable media. Its core value is providing a safe, intuitive, and powerful interface for disk management tasks that are typically performed at the system level, thereby making advanced storage configuration accessible to a broader range of users.\n\n### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations\n\n| Term | Definition |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **SRS** | Software Requirements Specification |\n| **MVP** | Minimum Viable Product |\n| **LiveCD** | A bootable CD/DVD/USB that contains an operating system runtime environment. |\n| **Partition** | A logically independent section of a data storage device. |\n| **File System** | A method and data structure for storing, retrieving, and managing files on a partition (e.g., ext4, NTFS, FAT32). |\n| **LVM2** | Logical Volume Manager 2, a device-mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel. |\n| **UI** | User Interface |\n\n### 1.4 References\n*   GNU General Public License (GPL)\n*   GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)\n\n### 1.5 Overview\nThe remainder of this document is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a general description of the product. Section 3 outlines the specific requirements, including functional, external interface, and non-functional requirements.\n\n## 2. Overall Description\n\n### 2.1 Product Perspective\nGParted is a self-contained application designed to operate independently of an installed operating system. It is part of the ecosystem of system administration tools and relies on a stack of underlying Linux system utilities and libraries (e.g., `parted`, `e2fsprogs`, `ntfs-3g`) to perform low-level disk operations.\n\n### 2.2 Product Functions\nThe high-level functions of GParted are:\n*   **Visualization:** Provide a graphical representation of storage devices and their partition layout.\n*   **Partition Management:** Create, delete, resize, and move disk partitions.\n*   **Data Safety:** Perform resize and move operations in a manner that aims to preserve existing data.\n*   **File System Operations:** Format partitions to various file systems and check/repair their integrity.\n*   **Data Manipulation:** Copy the entire contents of a partition and paste it to a different location on a disk.\n\n### 2.3 User Characteristics\nThe intended user base is diverse:\n*   **System Administrators:** Experts who require powerful tools for disk management.\n*   **Technical Enthusiasts:** Users with some technical knowledge who are installing or dual-booting operating systems.\n*   **End-Users in Data Recovery Scenarios:** Users following guided instructions to resize partitions or recover data.\n\n### 2.4 Constraints\n1.  **Environmental Constraint:** The application requires a working Linux environment, typically accessed via a bootable LiveCD or USB media.\n2.  **Functional Constraint:** The MVP does not support Logical Volume Management (LVM2). Operations on LVM physical volumes, volume groups, or logical volumes are outside the project's initial scope.\n3.  **Dependency Constraint:** The application's functionality is dependent on the presence and correct operation of third-party command-line tools and libraries for specific file systems (e.g., `ntfsresize` for NTFS, `dosfsck` for FAT).\n\n### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies\n*   It is assumed that the user has a basic understanding of disk partitions and the risks associated with modifying them.\n*   The application depends on the Linux kernel and a specific set of file system tools being available in the host environment.\n*   The correct operation of the application is dependent on the underlying hardware and kernel drivers for disk access.\n\n## 3. Specific Requirements\n\n### 3.1 External Interface Requirements\n\n#### 3.1.1 User Interfaces\nThe UI shall be a graphical desktop application conforming to the GNOME/GTK standards.\n*   **Main Window:** Shall display a graphical representation of disks and partitions in a pane.\n*   **Toolbar:** Shall provide quick access to frequently used operations (Create, Delete, Resize/Move, Copy, Paste, Undo, Apply).\n*   **Menu Bar:** Shall provide comprehensive access to all operations and settings.\n*   **Operation Pending List:** Shall display a list of operations queued for execution, allowing the user to review changes before applying them.\n\n#### 3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces\nThe application shall interface directly with block devices (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/nvme0n1`) through the Linux kernel.\n\n#### 3.1.3 Software Interfaces\nThe application shall call the following external command-line tools (non-exhaustive list):\n*   `parted`, `fdisk`: For partition table manipulation (create, delete).\n*   `e2fsprogs` (e.g., `resize2fs`, `e2fsck`): For ext2/3/4 file system operations.\n*   `ntfs-3g` / `ntfsprogs` (e.g., `ntfsresize`, `ntfsfix`): For NTFS operations.\n*   `dosfstools` (e.g., `mkfs.fat`, `fsck.fat`): For FAT16/FAT32 operations.\n*   `hfsutils`, `xfsprogs`, `btrfs-progs`, etc.: For other supported file systems.\n\n### 3.2 Functional Requirements\n\n#### 3.2.1 FR-1: Partition Visualization\n| **ID** | **FR-1** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Description** | The system shall provide a visual representation of all detected storage devices and their partitions. |\n| **Priority** | High |\n| **Inputs** | System probe for block devices. |\n| **Processing** | 1.

Add a sequence of operations to the queue: create a new partition in the destination space, format it, and copy all data block-by-block from the source to the destination. |\n| **Outputs** | A new partition is created which is a sector-by-sector or file-by-file copy of the source partition. |\n\n#### 3.2.7 FR-7: Check and Repair File System\n| **ID** | **FR-7** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Description** | The user shall be able to check a partition's file system for errors and attempt to repair them. |\n| **Priority** | Medium |\n| **Inputs** | User selects a partition and chooses \"Check\". |\n| **Processing** | 1. Ensure the partition is not mounted.<br>2. Execute the appropriate file system check tool (e.g., `e2fsck`, `ntfsfix`, `fsck`).<br>3. Parse and display the tool's output to the user. |\n| **Outputs** | The file system is checked, errors are reported, and repairs are attempted if possible. |\n\n#### 3.2.8 FR-8: Apply All Operations\n| **ID** | **FR-8** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Description** | The system shall queue all user-requested operations and execute them only upon an explicit \"Apply\" command. |\n| **Priority** | High |\n| **Inputs** | User clicks the \"Apply\" button in the toolbar. |\n| **Processing** | 1. Present a final summary dialog listing every operation that will be performed.<br>2. Require user confirmation to proceed.<br>3. Execute each operation in the queue sequentially and in the correct order.<br>4. Display real-time progress and the output log of each command. |\n| **Outputs** | All pending disk operations are physically written to the disk. |\n\n### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements\n\n#### 3.3.1 Performance Requirements\n*   The UI shall remain responsive during long-running operations (e.g., move, copy), providing progress feedback to the user.\n*   Scanning and reading partition information for all devices should complete within 10 seconds on a system with typical hardware (e.g., 1-4 disks).\n\n#### 3.3.2 Safety & Reliability Requirements\n*   **Data Loss Prevention:** The application shall require explicit confirmation before executing any destructive operation (delete, format) or a sequence of operations (via the \"Apply\" step).\n*   **Operation Validation:** The application shall perform feasibility checks before adding an operation to the queue (e.g., ensuring sufficient space for a new partition).\n*   **Error Handling:** The application shall gracefully handle errors from underlying command-line tools, abort the operation sequence if a critical error occurs, and present a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n#### 3.3.3 Security Requirements\n*   The application requires root privileges to perform disk operations. This is inherent to its design as a system administration tool.\n\n#### 3.3.4 Usability Requirements\n*   The graphical representation of partitions must be intuitive and accurately reflect the disk's geometry.\n*   Common tasks (Create, Delete, Resize/Move) should be accessible with a minimal number of clicks.\n*   The application shall provide tooltips and contextual help for its functions.\n\n### 3.4 Major Risks and Undecided Issues\n1.  **Potential for Data Loss:** The primary risk associated with GParted is irreversible data loss resulting from user error, software bugs, or hardware failure during partition manipulation. **Mitigation:** Clear warnings, an operation queue that requires final confirmation, and encouraging users to back up data before proceeding.\n2.  **Hardware/Software Compatibility:** Support for certain file systems or new storage technologies is dependent on the underlying tools and the Linux kernel version used in the LiveCD environment. This is an ongoing concern.",
