## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed description of the Software Requirements for the Data for Transportation Utility and Analytics Prototype (DUAP) system. The intended audience includes project stakeholders, researchers, software architects, developers, and testers. The purpose of this SRS is to define the functional and non-functional requirements that will guide the design, development, and validation of the DUAP prototype.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The DUAP system is a prototype research program designed to evaluate Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (VII) and related data for its potential to enhance transportation safety, mobility, and asset management within the state of Michigan. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on data collection, processing, and dissemination to establish a foundation for future research and development.

### 1.5 Document Overview
The remainder of this document describes the overall system, its features, and detailed requirements in sections 2 and 3.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The DUAP system is a self-contained research prototype. It will interact with external data providers (for probe, traffic, and weather data) and will provide processed information to internal researchers and analysts via web-based user interfaces. The system must integrate seamlessly with existing State of Michigan IT infrastructure and adhere to its standards.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The core functions of the DUAP MVP are:
1.  **Data Ingestion:** Collect data from multiple external sources, including probe vehicles, traffic sensors, and weather services.
2.  **Data Processing:** Derive higher-level traffic and incident information from raw probe vehicle data.
3.  **Data Publication:** Format and publish the processed data in the standardized SAE J2354 format for potential consumption by downstream systems.
4.  **Data Visualization:** Provide web-based user interfaces (UIs) for authorized users to browse and visualize traffic and weather information.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
| User Role | Description | Technical Skill Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transportation Researcher/Analyst** | Primary user who will analyze the processed data and visualizations to evaluate its utility. | Intermediate; proficient in using web applications but not necessarily a technical expert. |
| **System Administrator** | Responsible for the deployment, maintenance, and monitoring of the DUAP system. | Advanced; possesses strong IT and networking skills. |

### 2.4 Constraints
1.  **Regulatory/Policy Constraints:** The system MUST conform to all Michigan Department of Information Technology (MDIT) standards for software development, security, and deployment.
2.  **Data Standards Constraints:** All geographic references and spatial data MUST use the Michigan Geographic Framework (MGF).
3.  **Legal Constraints:** The system MUST implement mechanisms to protect data privacy and adhere to all data ownership agreements with third-party providers. Redistribution of raw source data may be prohibited.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   A stable connection to third-party data sources will be available.
    *   Authorized users will have access to the necessary network and credentials to use the web interfaces.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   The project is dependent on the continued availability and quality of third-party probe, traffic, and weather data feeds.
    *   The project relies on the stability and documentation of the SAE J2354 standard and the MGF.

## 3. System Features and Requirements

### 3.1 External Interface Requirements

#### 3.1.1 User Interfaces
