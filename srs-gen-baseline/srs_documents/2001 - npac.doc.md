## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) Service Management System (SMS). The SRS is intended to serve as a definitive guide for stakeholders, developers, testers, and project managers involved in the design, implementation, and verification of the NPAC SMS.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The NPAC SMS is a centralized, authoritative system for managing ported telephone numbers and their associated routing data. Its primary purpose is to enable Local Number Portability (LNP) by acting as the single source of truth for ported number subscriptions. The system facilitates the provisioning, modification, and decommissioning of ported numbers and ensures that all participating Service Providers (SPs) receive consistent and timely routing data updates.

| **SP** | Service Provider |
| **TN** | Telephone Number |
| **Ported Number** | A telephone number that has been transferred from one service provider to another. |

### 1.5 Document Overview
This document is organized into sections detailing the overall project description, specific system features, and both functional and non-functional requirements.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The NPAC SMS is a central component in the telecommunications ecosystem. It interfaces with multiple, independent Service Provider systems but operates as a standalone administrative system. It is not part of the real-time call path.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The core functions of the NPAC SMS MVP are:
1.  **Subscription Lifecycle Management:** Create, modify, and disconnect ported telephone number subscriptions.
2.  **Data Broadcast:** Notify all relevant SPs of any changes to ported number routing data.
3.  **Data Integrity:** Maintain consistency and accuracy of porting data through conflict resolution and audit capabilities.
4.  **High Availability:** Ensure system reliability and data persistence through disaster recovery and backup functionality.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The primary users of the NPAC SMS are:
*   **Service Provider Administrators:** Authorized personnel from competing SPs who initiate and manage porting requests for their customers. They are assumed to be technically proficient and trained on the NPAC SMS interface and procedures.

### 2.4 Constraints
1.  **Non-Real-Time Processing:** The NPAC SMS shall not be involved in the real-time processing or routing of voice calls.
2.  **Authorization Verification:** The system shall not verify end-customer authorization for a number porting request. This responsibility lies solely with the submitting Service Provider.
3.  **Bilateral Coordination:** All direct interactions and physical network changes between Service Providers required to complete a port are outside the system's scope.
4.  **Regulatory:** The system must comply with all applicable telecommunications regulations governing local number portability.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
*   **Assumption:** Service Providers will have secure and reliable network connectivity to the NPAC SMS.
*   **Assumption:** Service Providers are responsible for the accuracy and authorization of the data they submit.
*   **Dependency:** The system's disaster recovery plan is dependent on the capabilities of the chosen cloud/hosting infrastructure.

## 3. System Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Manage Ported Number Subscription
**Description:** The system shall allow authorized Service Providers to manage the full lifecycle of a ported number.

| ID | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FR-1.1** | The system shall allow a Service Provider to **provision** a new ported number subscription by submitting the TN, recipient SP ID, and effective date/time. |
| **FR-1.2** | The system shall allow a Service Provider to **disconnect** an existing ported number subscription. |
| **FR-1.3** | The system shall allow a Service Provider to **modify** specific attributes of an existing ported number subscription (e.g., update effective timestamps). |

#### FR-2: Broadcast Routing Data
**Description:** The system shall notify all relevant Service Providers of changes to ported number data.

| ID | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FR-2.1** | Upon successful activation or modification of a ported number, the system shall **generate and broadcast** an update message containing the new routing data. |
| **FR-2.2** | The broadcast shall be sent to **all Service Providers** identified as relevant to the numbering scope (e.g., local rate center). |
| **FR-2.3** | The system shall provide a confirmation mechanism to track the successful receipt of broadcast messages by SPs. |

#### FR-3: Ensure Data Consistency
**Description:** The system shall implement mechanisms to maintain data integrity across all Service Provider networks.

| ID | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FR-3.1** | The system shall implement a **conflict resolution** process to handle simultaneous update requests for the same telephone number (e.g., first-come-first-served or based on a defined business logic). |
| **FR-3.2** | The system shall maintain a complete and immutable **audit log** of all provisioning, modification, and disconnect activities, including the user/SP who performed the action and a timestamp. |
| **FR-3.3** | The system shall provide reporting capabilities to allow administrators to **reconcile data** between the NPAC SMS and individual Service Provider records. |

#### FR-4: Maintain System Availability
**Description:** The system shall be highly available and resilient to failures.

| ID | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FR-4.1** | The system shall implement a **disaster recovery** plan that allows for operation to be failed over to a secondary site with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of < 4 hours and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of < 15 minutes. |
| **FR-4.2** | The system shall perform **regular, automated backups** of all critical data, including the ported number database and audit logs. |

### 3.2 External Interface Requirements

#### EI-1: Service Provider Interface
*   **EI-1.1:** The system shall provide a secure, standards-based API (e.g., RESTful API with JSON/XML payloads over HTTPS) for all interactions with Service Provider systems.
*   **EI-1.2:** The system shall require authentication and authorization for all API requests from Service Providers.

#### EI-2: Administrative User Interface
*   **EI-2.1:** The system shall provide a secure web-based GUI for NPAC administrators to perform system monitoring, generate reports, and manage user access.

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements

#### NF-1: Performance
*   **NF-1.1:** The system shall process 99% of provisioning requests within 5 seconds under normal load.
*   **NF-1.2:** The broadcast of routing data to all relevant SPs shall be initiated within 30 seconds of a subscription activation/modification.

#### NF-2: Availability
*   **NF-2.1:** The system shall achieve 99.99% uptime, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.

#### NF-3: Security
*   **NF-3.1:** All data, both in transit and at rest, shall be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., TLS 1.2+ for transit, AES-256 for rest).
*   **NF-3.2:** The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict system functions based on user roles.
*   **NF-3.3:** The system shall log all security-relevant events (e.g., login attempts, permission changes).

#### NF-4: Data Integrity
*   **NF-4.1:** The system shall ensure that data is not lost or corrupted due to system failure through transactional integrity and robust backup procedures.

#### NF-5: Auditability
*   **NF-5.1:** The system shall retain a complete audit trail of all data changes for a minimum of 7 years to comply with regulatory requirements.
