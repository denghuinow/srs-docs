## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the Tarrant County Indigent Defense Management System (TCIDMS). The SRS will serve as a contract between the development team and the client, ensuring a mutual understanding of the system's capabilities and constraints. Any changes to this document require formal approval.

### 1.2 Document Conventions
- Requirements are specified using the **Shall** convention.
- Functional requirements are listed in Section 3.
- Markdown is used for formatting, with code blocks for structured data examples.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
- **Project Sponsors & County Management:** Focus on Sections 1 (Introduction) and 2 (Overall Description).
- **Judicial Staff & End-Users:** Focus on Sections 2.3 (User Classes) and 3 (System Features).
- **Developers, QA Testers, & System Architects:** Should read the entire document thoroughly.

### 1.4 Project Scope
The TCIDMS is a web-based software solution designed to integrate with the Tarrant County Integrated Justice Information System. Its primary goal is to automate and manage the process of appointing legal counsel to indigent defendants, ensuring compliance with the Texas Fair Defense Act (FDA) and related statutes. The system will replace manual, paper-based processes with a secure, efficient, and auditable electronic workflow.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The TCIDMS is a new, self-contained module that will integrate with existing county systems. It will function as a "feeder" system for attorney appointment data and a "consumer" of case and financial data.
