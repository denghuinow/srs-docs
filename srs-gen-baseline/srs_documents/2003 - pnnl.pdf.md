## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed description of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Automated HVAC Diagnostic Tool. It is intended for stakeholders, including project managers, developers, testers, and end-users, to serve as a definitive guide for the system's functionality, constraints, and behavior. Any changes to the requirements must be formally amended in this document.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The Automated HVAC Diagnostic Tool is a software application designed to automatically detect, identify, and diagnose performance and operational faults within HVAC subsystems—specifically chillers and cooling towers. By leveraging both real-time sensed data and static fixed data, the tool aims to enhance energy efficiency, improve operational reliability, and reduce maintenance costs through proactive fault identification and actionable recommendations.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

| Term/Acronym | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HVAC** | Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning |
| **MVP** | Minimum Viable Product |
| **SRS** | Software Requirements Specification |
| **Sensed Data** | Dynamic, real-time measurements collected from sensors (e.g., temperatures, pressures, flow rates). |
| **Fixed Data** | Static, unchanging information about the HVAC equipment (e.g., model numbers, design specifications, rated capacity). |
| **Fault** | A deviation from expected or normal operation in an HVAC subsystem that impacts performance or efficiency. |
| **Diagnostic Algorithm** | A predefined logical procedure or rule set used to analyze data and identify specific faults. |
| **Batch Processing** | The execution of diagnostic operations on a set of data provided via an input file, as opposed to real-time streaming. |

### 1.5 Document Overview
The remainder of this document describes the overall system, detailed functional and non-functional requirements, external interfaces, and other relevant specifications.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
This tool is a standalone, new software product. Its core function is to act as an analytical engine that sits between data sources (sensors, input files) and the end-user, providing diagnostic insights. The architecture must be modular to allow for the future inclusion of additional HVAC subsystems like boilers.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The primary functions of the system are:
1.  **Data Ingestion:** Acquire data from hardware sensors in real-time or from pre-formatted input files.
2.  **Fault Analysis:** Execute diagnostic algorithms on the ingested data to detect and identify specific faults in chillers and cooling towers.
3.  **Results Presentation:** Display clear and actionable diagnostic results to the user.
4.  **Data Management:** Securely store all input data and diagnostic results in a permanent database for historical analysis and reporting.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

| User Class | Characteristics | Key Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General User** | Technicians, facility managers. Has operational knowledge of HVAC systems. | View diagnostic results, run diagnostics on available data streams. |
| **Administrator** | System expert, IT staff. Has elevated system privileges. | Manage user accounts, configure system parameters (e.g., data source paths, algorithm thresholds), start/stop data acquisition services. |

### 2.4 Operating Environment
*   **Operating System:** The application shall be compatible with modern, supported Microsoft Windows operating systems (e.g., Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2019/2022).
*   **Software Dependencies:** A compatible relational database (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL) for permanent storage.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
1.  **Platform Constraint:** The application shall be developed to run exclusively on Microsoft Windows-compatible operating systems.
2.  **Scope Constraint:** The initial release (MVP) shall provide diagnostic capabilities for chiller and cooling tower subsystems only. The system architecture must be designed to accommodate future expansion to other subsystems (e.g., boilers, AHUs) without major refactoring.
3.  **Security Constraint:** A role-based access control (RBAC) system must be implemented to restrict privileged functions (e.g., system configuration, user management) to users with the 'Administrator' role.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
*   **Assumption:** Suitable hardware sensors are installed, calibrated, and accessible for real-time data acquisition.
*   **Assumption:** Input files for batch processing will be provided in a predefined, validated format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
*   **Dependency:** The availability and accuracy of diagnostic algorithms are dependent on domain expertise and may be updated in future versions.
