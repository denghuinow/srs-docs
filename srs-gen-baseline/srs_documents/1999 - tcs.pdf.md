## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed description of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Tactical Control System (TCS). It specifies the functional and non-functional requirements, system constraints, and external interfaces. This SRS is intended for use by the project stakeholders, including developers, testers, project managers, and end-users, to ensure a common understanding of the system to be developed.

### 1.2 Scope
The Tactical Control System (TCS) is a joint-service command and control (C2) system designed to provide interoperable control, data processing, and dissemination capabilities for tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their associated payloads. The system will enable military operators to plan and execute UAV missions, manage payloads, and seamlessly integrate with existing Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) infrastructure.

The system will initially support the **Predator** and **Outrider** UAV platforms. It is not within the scope of this version to control UAV platforms outside of these specified types or to replace core C4I battle management functions.

### 1.5 Overview
The remainder of this document is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overall description of the product. Section 3 specifies specific requirements, including external interfaces, functional capabilities, and non-functional attributes. Appendices may provide additional supporting information.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The TCS is a new, self-contained software system that will operate within a broader military C4I architecture. It is designed to be a modular component that interfaces with existing battlefield systems. The system must conform to the DII/COE standards to ensure interoperability and integration.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The high-level functions of the TCS are:
*   **Mission Management:** Plan, rehearse, execute, and monitor UAV missions.
*   **Vehicle Control:** Control UAV flight operations across five levels of interaction (e.g., from high-level command to direct manual control).
*   **Payload Management:** Control sensor payloads (e.g., EO/IR cameras, SAR) and manage their data.
*   **Data Handling:** Process, analyze, store, and disseminate imagery and other collected data.
*   **C4I Interoperability:** Exchange data and commands with external C4I systems.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The intended users are military personnel with specialized training, including:
*   **Mission Commanders:** Authorized to task and approve missions.
*   **UAV Operators:** Certified to pilot and navigate UAVs.
*   **Payload Operators:** Trained to operate specific sensor systems.
*   **Intelligence Analysts:** Responsible for analyzing and disseminating collected data.

### 2.4 Constraints
1.  **Architectural Constraint:** The system shall be built upon a **DII/COE-compliant open architecture**.
2.  **Design Constraint:** All hardware and software components must be **scalable and modular** to support future growth and integration of new UAV platforms and payloads.
3.  **Compliance Constraint:** All system components, including commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, must be **Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant**.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
*   It is assumed that trained personnel will be available to operate the system.
*   The system is dependent on stable communication links between the Ground Control Station (GCS) and the UAVs.
*   Successful integration is dependent on external C4I systems providing well-defined and stable interfaces.

## 3. Specific Requirements
