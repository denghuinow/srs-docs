## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the APAF (Analyser of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms) Ground Data System. This system processes telemetry data from the ASPERA-3 instrument and Mars Express spacecraft to generate scientific data products for analysis and archival.

### 1.2 Scope
The APAF Ground Data System will:
- Acquire telemetry data from European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) via NASA Integrated Services Network (NISN)
- Process raw telemetry into IDFS (Instrument Data File System) formatted data sets
- Provide web-based data visualization and analysis tools
- Archive data locally and submit to NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS)
- Distribute processed data to Co-Investigators (Co-Is)
