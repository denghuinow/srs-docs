## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the "Automated ISIN Issuance Service for Money Market Instruments" to be developed by the JSE in its capacity as South Africa's National Numbering Agent (NNA). The intended audience for this document includes project stakeholders, developers, testers, and project managers. This SRS will serve as the foundation for system design, implementation, and verification.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The system will automate the issuance, cancellation, and de-registration of International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) for Money Market Instruments (MMIs) in South Africa. This service will enable dematerialized trading and same-day settlement via STRATE by processing standardized electronic SWIFT messages, thereby replacing any existing manual or semi-automated processes.

**In-Scope:**
*   Automated processing of incoming MT598 SWIFT messages from STRATE.
*   Validation of message content and structure.
*   Automatic generation of new ISINs with the prefix "ZAM".
*   Processing of ISIN cancellation and de-registration requests.
*   Sending response messages back to STRATE.
*   Secure logging and auditing of all transactions.

**Out-of-Scope:**
*   Issuance of ISINs for other instrument types (e.g., equities, bonds).
*   A user interface for manual ISIN issuance.
*   Direct interaction with issuers or other financial institutions (all communication is via STRATE).
*   Management of the ISIN database for non-MMI instruments.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
This system is a new, standalone application that will integrate into the existing JSE financial market infrastructure. Its primary external interfaces are with the SWIFT network for message exchange and potentially with an internal JSE database for logging and reporting. It operates within the broader ecosystem managed by STRATE for settlement.

### 2.2 Product Functions (High-Level)
The core functions of the system are:
1.  **ISIN Creation:** Receive a valid MT598 request, validate it, generate a unique ISIN with the "ZAM" prefix, log the action, and return a confirmation message.
2.  **ISIN Cancellation:** Receive a valid MT598 cancellation request, validate it (e.g., check ISIN exists and is active), update the ISIN status to "Cancelled", log the action, and return a confirmation message.
3.  **ISIN De-registration:** Receive a valid MT598 de-registration request, validate it, update the ISIN status to "De-registered", log the action, and return a confirmation message.
4.  **Error Handling:** Process invalid or unparseable MT598 messages and return a corresponding error message to STRATE.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The primary "user" of this system is an automated process at **STRATE**. There is no direct human interaction with the system for its core MVP functions. System administrators and support staff at the JSE will require monitoring and reporting capabilities.

### 2.4 Constraints
1.  **Regulatory Compliance:** All ISINs issued must strictly comply with the rules and guidelines defined by ANNA and the ISO 6166 standard.
2.  **Message Standard:** All SWIFT message formats (MT598) and their contents must be approved by the MMF and NMPG before implementation.
3.  **Financial:** The total development and ongoing operational costs for this system must be fully recovered from STRATE via a mutually agreed commercial model.
4.  **Performance:** The system must be designed to handle a estimated load of **200 to 500 ISIN issuance requests per day** without degradation in performance, with a target processing time of seconds per request to facilitate same-day settlement.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
*   **Assumption:** STRATE will send well-formed MT598 messages as per the approved format.
*   **Assumption:** The "ZAM" prefix is reserved and approved for use exclusively for Money Market Instruments.
*   **Dependency:** Continuous and stable connectivity to the SWIFT network is required for system operation.
*   **Dependency:** Final approval of the MT598 message structure from MMF and NMPG is a prerequisite for development completion.

## 3. System Features and Requirements

This section details the functional requirements of the system.

### 3.1 Feature: Process ISIN Creation Request

**Description:** The system shall automatically create a new ISIN for a Money Market Instrument upon receiving a valid MT598 message from STRATE.

| ID | Requirement Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FUNC-CREATE-001** | The system shall listen for incoming MT598 messages on the designated SWIFT channel. |
| **FUNC-CREATE-002** | The system shall parse the MT598 message and extract all relevant fields for ISIN generation. |
| **FUNC-CREATE-003** | The system shall validate the structure and content of the incoming message against the MMF/NMPG-approved schema. |
| **FUNC-CREATE-004** | Upon successful validation, the system shall generate a new, unique ISIN. The ISIN shall have the prefix "ZAM", followed by a 9-character alphanumeric National Security Identifier, and a final check digit as per ISO 6166. |

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 SWIFT Interface
*   **Protocol:** The system must interface with the SWIFT Alliance suite (or equivalent) using standard SWIFTNet protocols.
*   **Message Type:** The system will send and receive **MT598 (Free Format Message)**.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
*   **Throughput:** The system must be capable of processing a peak load of **500 ISIN creation requests within a 24-hour period**.
*   **Latency:** The end-to-end processing time for a valid request (from receiving the MT598 to sending the response) shall be less than **30 seconds** under normal load to support same-day settlement.
*   **Availability:** The system shall achieve **99.5% operational availability** during standard South African market hours (e.g., 07:00 - 18:00 SAST).

### 5.2 Security Requirements
*   All data persisted by the system (e.g., ISIN records, logs) must be stored in an encrypted format.

### 5.3 Reliability Requirements
*   The system must ensure no data loss in the event of a failure. All processed ISINs must be permanently recorded.
*   The system shall have a Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of less than 2 hours.

### 5.4 Audit and Logging
*   The system shall maintain an immutable log of every MT598 message received and sent, including message content, timestamp, and processing result (success/failure).
*   All ISIN lifecycle events (creation, cancellation, de-registration) must be logged for a minimum period of 7 years to comply with financial regulations.
