# Example Ruby class structure for core entities
class User
  attr_accessor :id, :email, :password_hash, :role, :profile_data
  has_many :publications
  belongs_to :group
end

class Publication
  attr_accessor :id, :title, :authors, :abstract, :file_path
  attr_accessor :metadata, :upload_date, :publisher_id
  has_many :downloads

  attr_accessor :id, :name, :permissions
  has_many :users
end
```
