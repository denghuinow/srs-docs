## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for Project ZNIX, an object-based, application-independent information management framework. The framework is designed to refine traditional systems by emphasizing information semantics and user-defined logical access. This SRS serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, testers, and project stakeholders.

### 1.2 Scope
Project ZNIX provides a centralized framework for managing information from multiple third-party applications through a semantic, object-based approach. The system enables hierarchical organization, modification, and archival of information while maintaining structural integrity and providing API access to core functionality.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **Entity**: Core object unit representing information elements
- **Framework Shell**: Main user interface component
- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product
- **GUI**: Graphical User Interface
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **Unicode**: Universal character encoding standard

### 1.4 References
- Windows 2000 Logo Requirements
- Unicode Standard specifications
- Intel Pentium III architecture documentation

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Project ZNIX operates as a standalone information management framework that interfaces with third-party applications. The system architecture consists of:
- Core framework engine
- Browser-based GUI (Framework Shell)
- Public API layer
- Data persistence layer

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Centralized archiving of user information from third-party applications
- Hierarchical viewing and management of information objects
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Entities and relationships
- Information archival without hierarchy disruption
- Programmatic access via public API

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- **Primary Users**: Information workers managing data from multiple applications
- **Technical Users**: Developers integrating with the ZNIX API
- **Assumptions**: Users are familiar with hierarchical data structures and basic computer operations

### 2.4 Constraints
#### 2.4.1 Hardware Constraints
- Must run on Intel Pentium III or compatible 1-GHz processor
- Minimum 256 MB system RAM
- Framework Shell memory usage must not exceed 40 MB

#### 2.4.2 Software Constraints
- Must conform to Windows 2000 Logo Requirements
- Must support Unicode standards
- Browser-based GUI compatibility requirements

- Windows 2000 compatible environment is available

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 External Interface Requirements

#### 3.1.1 User Interfaces
- **Framework Shell**: Browser-based GUI supporting hierarchical data visualization
- **Navigation**: Tree-based hierarchy navigation with expand/collapse functionality
- **Management Interface**: Contextual menus for Entity operations (add, remove, modify, archive)

#### 3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces
- Compatible with standard PC input devices (keyboard, mouse)
- Supports standard display resolutions (800x600 minimum recommended)

#### 3.1.3 Software Interfaces
- **Third-party Application Integration**: Standard data import interfaces
- **Public API**: RESTful or equivalent API for Entity management
- **Unicode Support**: Full UTF-8/UTF-16 character encoding support

#### 3.1.4 Communications Interfaces
- Standard HTTP/HTTPS for browser GUI
- API communication protocol (to be specified in detailed design)

### 3.2 Functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Information Archiving (FR-01)
**Requirement**: The system shall provide a centralized archive for user information from specified third-party applications.

**Details**:
- Support multiple third-party application data sources
- Maintain data integrity during import process
- Preserve semantic relationships between imported data elements

#### 3.2.2 Hierarchical Viewing (FR-02)
**Requirement**: The system shall enable hierarchical viewing and management of information through a browser GUI.

**Details**:

- Support multiple hierarchy levels
- Provide visual indicators for Entity types and relationships

#### 3.2.3 Entity Management (FR-03)
**Requirement**: Users shall be able to add, remove, modify, and archive information without disrupting the hierarchy.

**Details**:
- **Add**: Create new Entities at any hierarchy level
- **Remove**: Delete Entities with confirmation and optional cascade deletion
- **Modify**: Edit Entity properties and relationships
- **Archive**: Move Entities to archival state while maintaining hierarchical references

#### 3.2.4 API Access (FR-04)
**Requirement**: The system shall expose functionality through a public API for creating, modifying, and querying Entities and relationships.

**Details**:
- **Entity Operations**: Create, read, update, delete Entities
- **Relationship Management**: Establish, modify, and remove inter-Entity relationships
- **Query Interface**: Search and filter capabilities across the Entity hierarchy

### 3.3 Performance Requirements

    createEntity(parentId: string, entityData: Object): Promise<Entity>;
    getEntity(entityId: string): Promise<Entity>;
    updateEntity(entityId: string, updates: Object): Promise<Entity>;
    deleteEntity(entityId: string, cascade: boolean): Promise<void>;
    archiveEntity(entityId: string): Promise<Entity>;
    
    // Relationship Management
    createRelationship(sourceId: string, targetId: string, relationshipType: string): Promise<Relationship>;
    removeRelationship(relationshipId: string): Promise<void>;
    
    // Query Interface
    queryEntities(filters: QueryFilters): Promise<Entity[]>;
