# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The I-15 Reversible Lane Control System (RLCS) application software replaces an outdated system to manage reversible lanes during peak traffic and special events. It interfaces with new field hardware and supports safe, automated opening and closing sequences.

- **In scope**:
  - Graphical user interface for system monitoring and control.
  - Process monitoring and control of field devices.
  - Sequencing of opening and closing operations.
  - Data processing, security, and reporting functions.
  - External system interfaces for data sharing.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Wireless connections between FCU and DCU controllers.
  - Programming changes for future roadway modifications.
  - Real-time input from external systems.
  - Manual operation of field devices without system override.
  - Expansion beyond specified device and controller limits.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As an Operator, I want to control the system during normal mode so that reversible lanes operate safely.
  - As a Field Maintenance Staff, I want to execute maintenance mode control sequences so that devices can be serviced.
  - As a System Administrator, I want to configure system data and security so that access and operations are managed securely.

- **Success metrics**:
  - System availability of 99.99% (approximately 50 minutes downtime per year).
  - Device status updates within 2 seconds of change.
  - Successful execution of daily opening and closing sequences without critical failures.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Must use commercial off-the-shelf software for database and reporting.
  - No wireless communications between FCU and DCU due to security.
  - System must operate 24/7 with 10-minute recovery from failures.
  - All control unit software and data must reside in non-volatile memory.
  - Use of MD5 algorithm for data integrity and password encryption.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific intelligent controller model (e.g., 2070 ATC or equivalent).
  - Final RLCS architecture design (to be revised by contractor).
  - Vendor selection for COTS database and reporting tools.
