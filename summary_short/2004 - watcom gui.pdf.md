# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: This document outlines the approach for porting the Open Watcom GUI library to Linux using the GTK toolkit, based on version 1.1.7, to enable cross-platform GUI application development.
- **In scope**:
  - Porting low-level GUI library functions to GTK.
  - Implementing window, dialog, and control creation.
  - Supporting text rendering, drawing, and font handling.
  - Enabling menu, toolbar, and status window functionality.
  - Handling scrolling, colors, and input events.
- **Out of scope**:
  - MDI "Windows in Window" model support.
  - Native help subsystem implementation.
  - Direct handling of Windows/OS/2-style resource files.
  - System menu modification.
  - Static numeric widget identifiers.
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a developer, I want to create windows and dialogs so that I can build GUI applications on Linux.
  - As a user, I want consistent text and drawing rendering so that the interface appears as expected.
  - As a maintainer, I want reusable type definitions and functions so that the port remains maintainable.
- **Success metrics**:
  - The standard Open Watcom GUI sample program runs successfully.
  - All ported functions behave consistently with the original library.
  - The library compiles and links on target Linux systems.
- **Major constraints**:
  - GTK API is significantly different from Windows/OS/2 APIs.
  - No support for MDI "Windows in Window" model in GTK.
  - Resource files require conversion or alternative handling.
  - Window managers may ignore initial placement requests.
  - Static linking may increase library size.
- **Undecided issues**:
  - Handling of Windows/OS/2 resource files (e.g., string tables).
  - Memory allocation reuse for text buffers.
  - Input device focus and shift-key state handling.
  - MDI menu enable/disable behavior.
  - Not mentioned.
