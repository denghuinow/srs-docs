# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The APAF ground data system processes ASPERA-3 instrument telemetry and Mars Express orbit/attitude data into IDFS data sets for scientific analysis and public archiving. Its main goal is to support the Mars Express mission by delivering validated data to the science team and NASA PDS within six months of acquisition.

- **In scope**:
  - Acquire ASPERA-3 and Mars Express telemetry from ESOC.
  - Process science, engineering, and ancillary data into IDFS data sets.
  - Store telemetry and IDFS data on a local SwRI archive.
  - Provide password-protected and public web-based data displays.
  - Distribute IDFS data and software to ASPERA-3 Co-Investigators.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Multiple operational states or modes.
  - Installation-dependent adaptation requirements.
  - Safety-related requirements.
  - Design and implementation constraints.
  - Training requirements for developers or operators.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a **Science Team Member**, I want to access processed IDFS data so that I can perform scientific analysis.
  - As a **System Operator**, I want automated daily telemetry processing so that data products are generated reliably.
  - As a **Public User**, I want web-based displays of current data so that I can monitor instrument performance and mission status.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Deliver IDFS data to Co-Investigators within 24 hours of error-free telemetry acquisition.
  - Submit validated, PDS-compliant data to NASA PDS within six months of acquisition.
  - Provide continuous web-based data displays for public and science team use.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Use UNIX-based development and production systems.
  - Depend on ESOC for telemetry data delivery.
  - Ensure password protection for sensitive science data displays.
  - Maintain a network connection between SwRI and NISN.
  - Archive all telemetry and IDFS data locally at SwRI.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific data distribution mechanisms to Co-Investigators.
  - Final definition of science analysis web displays.
  - Details of intermediate file generation if ESOC does not provide cleaned telemetry.
  - Adaptation requirements, if any, to be defined later.
  - Not mentioned: Long-term archival strategy beyond PDS submission.
