# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) is developing the VII Data Use Analysis and Processing (DUAP) System as a research prototype to evaluate how Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) data can enhance safety, mobility, and asset management. The system aims to collect, process, and disseminate VII data for transportation operations and planning.

- **In scope**:
  - Collecting probe vehicle, traffic, weather, and road condition data from multiple sources.
  - Processing data to derive traffic, incident, and road condition information.
  - Publishing processed data in standardized formats for external systems.
  - Providing web-based user interfaces for browsing traffic, incident, and weather information.
  - Archiving data for long-term analysis and research.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Operational deployment (system is a prototype for demonstration and assessment).
  - Real-time data processing with guaranteed latency (data is "near real-time").
  - Integration with all potential future data sources (some interfaces are deferred).
  - Full-scale production-level system maintenance and scalability.
  - Privacy and data ownership policy enforcement (addressed as external constraints).

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a transportation agency operator, I want to view traffic incidents and conditions so that I can manage traffic flow and respond to events.
  - As a system administrator, I want to configure and manage DUAP services so that the system operates correctly and securely.
  - As a researcher, I want to access archived VII data so that I can analyze transportation trends and effectiveness.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Ability to collect and process VII probe data from multiple sources.
  - Accurate derivation of traffic measures (e.g., speed, travel time, incidents) from probe data.
  - Successful publication of data in required formats (e.g., SAE J2354, TMDD).

- **Major constraints**:
  - Conformance to Michigan Department of Information Technology (MDIT) standards.
  - Use of Michigan Geographic Framework for geo-references.
  - Data latency and quality limitations from vehicle sensors and transmission.
  - Privacy and data ownership policies for VII data.
  - Dependence on VII network deployment and vehicle participation.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific interface formats for some data sources (e.g., transit fleets, traffic.com).
  - Integration with deferred data sources (e.g., Ann Arbor Transit, DDOT).
  - Implementation of some computational algorithms (e.g., travel demand derivation).
  - Support for additional output formats (e.g., traffic analysis tools).
  - Not mentioned: Long-term funding and operational transition plans.
