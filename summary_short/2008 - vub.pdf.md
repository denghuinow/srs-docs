# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The Publications Management System (PMS) is designed to manage a database of bibliographic information and full-text publications, supporting automated metadata extraction and access control for academic users at the Free University of Brussels (VUB).

- **In scope**:
  - Web and command-line access with role-based permissions.
  - Upload and automatic extraction of bibliographic data from PDF/PostScript files.
  - Search and download of publications with support for BibTeX and RIS formats.
  - User registration and validation via email.
  - Hierarchical user roles (Guest, VUB-Network User, Member, Publisher, Moderator, Administrator).

- **Out of scope**:
  - Support for MS Word, audio, or video file formats.
  - Automatic author/institute disambiguation (e.g., "D. Vermeir" vs. "Dirk Vermeir").
  - Automatic retrieval of full texts from URLs in BibTeX files.
  - Expansion to non-academic or multimedia content.
  - Portability to non-Linux operating systems without adjustments.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a Guest, I want to register an account so that I can access PMS features.
  - As a VUB-Network User, I want to search and download publications so that I can access academic resources.
  - As an Administrator, I want to manage user accounts and system settings so that I can maintain PMS security and functionality.

- **Success metrics**:
  - System availability at all times when Wilma server is operational.
  - Consistent database integrity with no redundant or orphaned records.
  - Secure encrypted password storage and transmission.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Must run on Linux (Wilma server) using Ruby without frameworks.
  - Web interface must comply with W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional standards.
  - Only free software and libraries may be used.
  - Modular design required for future expansions.
  - Functions must be accessible in minimal clicks while maintaining structure.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Maximum file size for uploaded publications.
  - Performance requirements (e.g., response times, concurrent users).
  - Specific installation procedure details.
  - Link to Software Test Plan (STD) document.
  - Not mentioned.
