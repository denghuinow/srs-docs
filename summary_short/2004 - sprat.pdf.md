# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: SPRAT addresses misalignment between privacy policies and system requirements by providing a tool for goal and scenario mining, reconciliation, and management to improve policy analysis and compliance.
- **In scope**:
  - User access control with four role levels (administrator, project manager, analyst, guest).
  - Goal and scenario specification, classification, and traceability.
  - Policy document management with domain assignment.
  - Access control policy analysis (RACAF module).
  - Flesch readability scoring for policy documents.
- **Out of scope**:
  - Full automation of conflict resolution between requirements and policies.
  - Complete translation of Ponder policies to Alloy specifications.
  - Comprehensive statistical analysis for multi-user comparison.
  - Full implementation of all low-priority functional modules.
  - Not mentioned.
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As an administrator, I want to manage user groups and reset passwords so that system access is controlled securely.
  - As a project manager, I want to assign analysts and manage policy domains so that projects are organized and access-restricted.
  - As an analyst, I want to classify goals and scenarios so that privacy and security requirements are accurately captured.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Traceability maintained between goals and source policies.
  - Secure user authentication and access logging implemented.
  - Multi-user analysis comparison supported without bias.
- **Major constraints**:
  - Security requirements are high priority and must be satisfied.
  - Access logs must record all add, delete, and edit actions.
  - Analyst classification results are hidden from others until completion to prevent bias.
  - Partial support only for Ponder-to-Alloy translation.
  - Passwords must be stored securely in the database.
- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific statistical methods for multi-user analysis comparison.
  - Full conflict identification and resolution mechanisms.
  - Complete implementation details for low-priority modules.
  - Not mentioned.
