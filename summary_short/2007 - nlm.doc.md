# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The National Library of Medicine (NLM) requires a robust digital repository to acquire, preserve, and provide access to biomedical digital materials, fulfilling its mission to manage both digitized and born-digital collections for long-term availability.

- **In scope**:
  - Ingest, archival storage, and access for digital materials under Library Operations.
  - Support for multiple formats including TIFF, PDF, XML, and audio/video files.
  - Integration with existing NLM systems like PubMed Central and the Integrated Library System.
  - Metadata generation and management for descriptive, administrative, and structural data.
  - Preservation planning to monitor technology and community needs.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Digital projects not part of Library Operations’ collecting responsibility (e.g., UMLS, Visible Human).
  - Web harvesting functionality; separate software will be used.
  - Maintenance of special software for accessing obsolete formats.
  - Materials with no long-term preservation value based on NLM permanence ratings.
  - Offline delivery of repository content.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a **Content Producer**, I want to submit digital materials so that they are preserved and accessible.
  - As an **End User**, I want to search and retrieve digital objects so that I can use them for research and reference.
  - As an **NLM Staff Member**, I want to manage metadata and objects so that repository content remains accurate and usable.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Successful ingest and preservation of digital objects in approved formats.
  - High availability and accessibility of repository materials to designated user communities.
  - Compliance with OAIS standards and NLM security policies.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Must integrate with existing NLM digital repositories (e.g., PubMed Central).
  - Adherence to HHS/NIH security and backup requirements.
  - Support for non-standard formats for important historical materials.
  - Dependence on NLM’s Integrated Library System for bibliographic data.
  - Limited staff resources for system testing and implementation.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific migration strategies and methodologies for digital preservation.
  - Policies for ingest, including authorized staff and submission requirements.
  - Review and potential revision of NLM metadata schemes and DTDs.
  - Development of detailed preservation and packaging designs.
  - Not mentioned: Final budget and detailed implementation timeline.
