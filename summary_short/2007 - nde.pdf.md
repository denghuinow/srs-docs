# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The NDE system aims to process and distribute NPOESS and NPP satellite data to NOAA and civilian users, supporting operational and climate communities by generating tailored products and ensuring long-term archival.
- **In scope**:
  - Ingest and process data from IDPS and other sources.
  - Generate NOAA-unique and tailored data products in multiple formats.
  - Distribute products to authorized users and archive to CLASS.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a customer, I want to subscribe to data products so that I receive timely environmental data.
  - As an operator, I want to monitor system health and performance so that I can ensure continuous service.
  - As a developer, I want to integrate and test system elements so that I can validate new capabilities.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Achieve 99% reliability for scheduled and event-driven tasks over 30 days.
  - Meet product latency targets (e.g., <5 minutes from data receipt to availability).
  - Ensure system availability (e.g., <2 hours interruption per 24-hour period for key capabilities).
- **Major constraints**:
  - Must comply with Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) and NOAA security policies.
  - Use existing hardware and software where possible and approved.
  - Support scalability without infrastructure redesign.
- **Undecided issues**:
