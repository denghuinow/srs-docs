# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: PDF Split and Merge (PDFsam) is an open-source tool designed to provide free, efficient PDF manipulation through a simple graphical interface, enabling users to split, merge, and modify PDF files easily.
- **In scope**: Splitting PDFs by pages or bookmarks; merging multiple PDFs or sections; visually reordering, rotating, or composing pages; saving/loading working environments; and console command-line support.
- **Out of scope**: Web-based functionality; real-time collaboration; editing PDF content (text/images); advanced security features; integration with cloud storage.
- **Roles and core use cases**:  
  - As a general user, I want to split and merge PDFs so that I can organize documents without cost.  
  - As a power user, I want to use the console for batch operations so that I can automate repetitive tasks.  
  - As a developer, I want to extend PDFsam’s plugins so that I can contribute to the open-source project.
- **Success metrics**: Support for all listed PDF manipulation features; compatibility with major OS platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac); user ability to perform tasks without advanced technical knowledge.
- **Major constraints**: Requires Java Runtime Environment 1.6 or higher; maximum memory usage ~254MB by default; output file compression requires PDF version 1.5+; licensed under GNU GPL; GUI built with Java Swing.
- **Undecided issues**: Not mentioned.
