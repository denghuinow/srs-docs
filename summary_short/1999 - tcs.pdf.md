# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The Tactical Control System (TCS) is a joint-service command, control, and data processing system designed to operate with tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including Predator and Outrider, and interface with C4I systems. Its purpose is to provide a scalable, interoperable system for UAV mission planning, control, and data dissemination.

- **In scope**:
  - Mission planning, control, and monitoring for UAVs and payloads.
  - Payload product management, including imagery processing and exploitation.
  - Integration with C4I systems and external data links.
  - System startup, operations, and shutdown states.
  - Maintenance and fault detection for system components.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Nuclear safety requirements.
  - Privacy-related requirements.
  - Reusability as a system quality factor.
  - Usability as a system quality factor.
  - Adaptation requirements.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a UAV operator, I want to control and monitor UAVs and payloads so that I can execute reconnaissance and surveillance missions.
  - As a mission planner, I want to generate and upload flight and payload plans so that UAVs can perform autonomous missions.
  - As a maintenance technician, I want to perform system diagnostics and software upgrades so that the TCS remains operational and up-to-date.

- **Success metrics**:
  - System availability equal to or greater than Predator and Outrider ORD specifications.
  - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) meeting ORD thresholds.
  - Mission plan storage capacity of at least 500 unique plans.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Compliance with DII/COE, JTA, and CIGSS standards.
  - Use of non-proprietary, scalable hardware and software.
  - Year 2000 compliance for all hardware and software components.
  - Operation within specified environmental and electromagnetic conditions.
  - Adherence to MIL-STD-498 for software development and documentation.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific electromagnetic environment values for system operation.
  - Risk levels and hazard management program details.
  - Integration and operation from submarines and ships (objective capability).
  - Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) decontamination procedures.
  - Not mentioned: Final implementation details for certain C4I interfaces.
