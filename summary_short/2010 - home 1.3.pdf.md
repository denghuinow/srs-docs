# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The DigitalHome project aims to develop a prototype smart home system to help HomeOwner Inc. make business decisions about future commercial products, focusing on integrating security, environmental, and energy management for home residents.

- **In scope**:
  - Management of temperature, humidity, security, and appliance power via web interface.
  - Support for up to eight thermostats and humidistats, fifty contact sensors, and one hundred power switches.
  - Monthly planning and reporting features for environmental and security data.
  - Wireless communication between home devices and a central gateway.
  - User authentication and data encryption for security.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Physical home or actual sensors—all components will be simulated.
  - Entertainment and communications systems integration.
  - Long-term commercial product development beyond the prototype.
  - Real-time video surveillance or advanced automation beyond specified controls.
  - Integration with non-specified home appliances or third-party systems.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a **General User**, I want to monitor and control home environment settings so that I can manage daily comfort and security.
  - As a **Master User**, I want to configure system parameters and user accounts so that I can customize and maintain system access.
  - As a **DH Technician**, I want to set up and maintain system configuration so that the system operates reliably and meets user needs.

- **Success metrics**:
  - System reliability with no more than 1 failure per 10,000 hours of operation.
  - Completion of the prototype within twelve months using a five-engineer team.
  - Adherence to performance standards such as sensor data updates every two seconds.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Development must use widely available hardware/software and minimize costs.
  - All testing must occur in a simulated environment with realistic physical constraints.
  - Object-oriented development and UML 2.0 are required unless approved by the CIO.
  - Changes to requirements must be approved by the DigitalHomeOwner Division Director.
  - System must support standard HVAC systems and comply with ASHRAE guidelines.
