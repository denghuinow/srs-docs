# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: PeaZip is a cross-platform file and archive manager providing a graphical interface for open-source compression utilities, enabling users to handle multiple archive formats and perform file management tasks efficiently.
- **In scope**:
  - Creating, updating, and extracting archives in supported formats.
  - Secure file deletion, byte-to-byte comparison, and file splitting/joining.
  - Two-factor authentication (password and keyfile) for archives.
  - Drag-and-drop support between system and application interfaces.
  - Customizable settings for language, compression, and interface layout.
- **Out of scope**:
  - Web-based communication interfaces.
  - Installation of third-party software for core functionality.
  - Support for non-x86 CPU architectures.
  - Drag-and-drop from application to system on non-Windows OS.
  - Not mentioned.
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a user, I want to compress and extract files so that I can save storage space and manage archives easily.
  - As a user, I want to securely delete files so that data recovery is prevented.
  - As a user, I want to customize application settings so that the interface and functions match my preferences.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Support for all listed archive formats for creation and extraction.
  - Cross-platform compatibility with Windows, Linux, BSD, and UNIX-like systems.
  - Secure authentication and deletion without data remnants.
- **Major constraints**:
  - Requires x86-compatible CPU due to ASM code.
  - Developed in Delphi/Kylix, Object Pascal, or Pascal.
  - LGPL license mandates open-source compliance.
  - Dependent on GTK/GDK libraries for some systems.
  - Drag-and-drop to system limited to Windows OS.
- **Undecided issues**:
