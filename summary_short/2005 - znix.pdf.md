# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: Project ZNIX aims to refine traditional information management systems by providing an object-based, application-independent retrieval and manipulation framework, emphasizing information semantics and user-defined logical access.

- **In scope**:
  - Centralized archive for user information.
  - Hierarchical model for managing archived information.
  - Archiving to removable storage with residue tracking.
  - Public API for ZNIX-aware client applications.
  - Integration with specified third-party applications.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Multi-user or networked operation.
  - Communication interfaces.
  - Special hardware interfacing.
  - Exhaustive user documentation.
  - Design constraints.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a home user, I want to manage information hierarchically so that I can access it logically.
  - As a developer, I want to use the public API so that I can build ZNIX-aware applications.
  - As a researcher, I want to archive information to removable media so that I can preserve and later retrieve it.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) exceeds 3 months.
  - Framework Shell utilizes no more than 40 MB of RAM.
  - GUI allows basic Windows users to interact instinctively.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Hardware: Intel Pentium III or compatible 1-GHz PC with 256 MB RAM.
  - Single-user mode only.
  - Must guard against malicious scripts and unintended user corruption.
  - Must conform to Windows 2000 Logo Requirements and Unicode standards.
  - Must run on Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Integration of browser with Windows Explorer.
  - Specific coding conventions.
  - Hosting platform for open-source distribution.
  - Developer’s Guide compilation.
  - Not mentioned.
