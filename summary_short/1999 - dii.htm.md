# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The DII COE XML Services (XS) provide infrastructure services for mission and support applications using XML technology to ensure interoperability, isolate vendor-specific implementations, and manage distributed data access across defense systems.

- **In scope**:
  - Registration of XML terms, tags, and structures.
  - Design of XML schemas and documents.
  - Generation and consumption of XML documents.
  - Registry services for producers, consumers, and managers.
  - Validation and conformance checking of XML documents.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Personnel and training requirements.
  - Detailed process descriptions and data structures.
  - Expansion on internal data elements of DBIF, DAC, and COTS RDBMS.
  - Specific packaging and logistics implementation details.
  - Non-COE platform support.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a **producer**, I want to submit metadata and XML artifacts to the registry so that semantic understanding and reuse are maximized.
  - As a **consumer**, I want to discover and view XML tags and structures so that I can reuse them in applications.
  - As a **manager**, I want to manage user access and naming conventions so that registry integrity and standards compliance are maintained.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Interoperability between defense applications using XML.
  - Compliance with DII COE standards and platforms.
  - Effective reuse of registered XML tags and schemas.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Must operate on COE-compliant platforms.
  - Must comply with DOD data standards and naming conventions.
  - Must support dynamic and degraded communication environments.
  - Must interface with existing COE components and commercial RDBMS products.
  - Must adhere to DII COE packaging and distribution guidelines.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific external and internal API details.
  - Detailed metadata and procedure updates.
  - Mapping of requirements to precedence and criticality.
