# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: This plan ensures the CAISO grid has sufficient Black Start generators to self-start and restore power after a major blackout, meeting WECC restoration requirements.
- **In scope**:  
  - Black Start capability planning and contingency studies  
  - Generator testing for Black Start units  
  - Recordkeeping of Black Start resources  
  - Operator training for system restoration  
  - Coordination with neighboring Balancing Authorities
- **Out of scope**:  
  - Generators that can only reject load to auxiliary levels  
  - Non-Black Start ancillary services  
  - Day-to-day market operations  
  - Non-CAISO Balancing Authority restoration  
  - Environmental or safety procedure details
- **Roles and core use cases**:  
  - As a **CAISO planner**, I want to determine Black Start requirements so that restoration needs are met.  
  - As a **generator owner**, I want to test Black Start capability so that my unit can be certified.  
  - As a **grid operator**, I want training on Black Start procedures so that I can execute restoration.
- **Success metrics**:  
  - Annual verification of sufficient Black Start resources  
  - Successful Black Start tests for at least one-third of contracted units  
  - Compliance with NERC/WECC restoration standards
- **Major constraints**:  
  - Black Start units must self-start without off-site power  
  - Start-up time limits vary by generator technology  
  - Hydro units not tested during constrained water availability  
  - Voltage/frequency regulation during restoration  
  - Transmission path availability for cranking
- **Undecided issues**:  
  - Specific percentage of expected Black Start unit failures  
  - Full system simulator availability timeline  
  - Start time limits for unspecified/out-of-area technologies
