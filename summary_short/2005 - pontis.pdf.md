# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: Pontis 5.0 is the next-generation Bridge Management System (BMS) intended to replace Pontis 4.x, providing updated tools for bridge data management, condition assessment, modeling, and reporting while preserving existing agency investments and leveraging modern technology.
- **In scope**:
  - Bridge inventory and inspection data management.
  - Preservation model development and program simulation.
  - Project and program development capabilities.
  - Data exchange in formats including NBI, PDI, and XML.
  - System administration and user role management.
- **Out of scope**:
  - Architectural or data model details (to be defined in later design documents).
  - Specific design or implementation plans for functional requirements.
  - Hosted application deployment (designed for agency installation).
  - Support for non-Microsoft browsers beyond Internet Explorer.
  - Custom personalization of user interface (e.g., skins).
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As an inspector, I want to enter and edit inspection data so that bridge conditions are accurately recorded and maintained.
  - As a bridge management engineer, I want to develop preservation policies and run simulations so that optimal maintenance strategies are identified.
  - As a system administrator, I want to manage user roles and application configurations so that system security and functionality are maintained.
- **Success metrics**:
  - System availability of 98% during operational hours (18 hours/day, 353 days/year).
  - User comfort with software after two days of training (or two hours for data viewing).
  - Successful migration path for existing Pontis 4.x databases and customizations.
- **Major constraints**:
  - Development using Microsoft .NET technologies and compatibility with Internet Explorer.
  - Support for Sybase, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server databases.
  - Adherence to ANSI-SQL and ODBC/JDBC/.NET standards for potential future database support.
  - Compliance with AASHTO application development standards.
  - Integration with other BRIDGEWare products and TransXML schema.
- **Undecided issues**:
  - Level of ADA compliance implementation.
  - Specific third-party software libraries to be utilized.
  - Support for tablet or handheld computers.
  - Licensing arrangements for web application users.
  - Approach for replacing PowerBuilder/InfoMaker dependency in reports and forms.
