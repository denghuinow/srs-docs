# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The OpenSG EIM System Requirements Specification aims to establish a foundation for interoperable Smart Grid systems by defining enterprise information management strategies and architectures. It seeks to address integration, data sharing, and semantic consistency challenges across utility systems.

- **In scope**:
  - Business, application, data, and technology architecture views.
  - Use cases and integration requirements for EIM.
  - Incorporation of standards like IEC CIM into enterprise models.
  - Governance and competency center considerations.
  - Information security integration across all EIM components.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Detailed process workflows and data structure specifications.
  - Specific implementation technologies or vendor products.
  - Individual business unit operational procedures.
  - Non-Smart Grid standalone system designs.
  - Legacy system migration step-by-step plans.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a business architect, I want to define EIM use cases so that business processes are aligned with integration goals.
  - As a data architect, I want to incorporate standard models so that semantic interoperability is achieved.
  - As a system integrator, I want logical application components so that services can be consistently deployed.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Semantic consistency across integration services.
  - Interoperability with external entities and standards.
  - Effective governance and knowledge distribution.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Must align with TOGAF 9.0 architecture domains.
  - Must incorporate IEC Common Information Model (CIM).
  - Must address both Smart Grid and non-Smart Grid data requirements.
  - Must integrate security into all architecture components.
  - Must support business-to-business and consumer model sharing.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - EIM support for process-oriented information perspectives.
  - Self-healing and self-discovery capability definitions.
  - Patterns for interfacing new technologies with older systems.
  - Logical data model enhancement processes.
  - Not mentioned.
