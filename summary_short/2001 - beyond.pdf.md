# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The BEYOND project aims to develop intelligent, adaptive user interfaces across multiple domains to improve usability, safety, and efficiency. This deliverable summarizes progress toward the second milestone and outlines functional specifications for evolving prototypes.

- **In scope**:
  - Public terminals and kiosks with multimodal and adaptive features.
  - Home entertainment UI editors for flexible, customizable interfaces.
  - Vetronics ruggedized displays with user-definable interfaces.
  - Avionics intelligent adaptive flight decks for enhanced flight safety.
  - Component-based architectures for extensibility.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Longitudinal usability studies due to time constraints.
  - Touch-screen integration in the avionics second prototype.
  - Full natural language understanding in public terminals.
  - On-line adaptivity in consumer UI editors.
  - Multimodal input beyond touch and speech in Vetronics.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a public user, I want intuitive multimodal interaction so that I can access information quickly and effectively.
  - As a UI developer, I want flexible authoring tools so that I can rapidly prototype and customize interfaces.
  - As a pilot, I want adaptive flight deck assistance so that I can maintain situation awareness and safety.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Improved user acceptance and satisfaction through expert reviews and questionnaires.
  - Enhanced system stability and performance in public and professional environments.
  - Effective code generation and simulation capabilities in UI development tools.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Limited German funding impacted usability workpackage resources.
  - Consumer domain hardware limitations (e.g., RAM, processing power).
  - Ruggedized display requirements for harsh environmental conditions.
  - Real-time performance needs in avionics and Vetronics systems.
  - Compatibility with existing platforms and communication standards.
