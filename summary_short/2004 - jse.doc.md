# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The JSE, as South Africa's National Numbering Agent (NNA), must provide an automated ISIN issuance service for Money Market Instruments (MMIs) to support dematerialization and same-day electronic settlement. The objective is to enable STRATE to electronically request, amend, and cancel ISINs via SWIFT messages to meet MMF requirements.

- **In scope**:
  - Automated issuance, cancellation, and deregistration of ISINs for MMIs via SWIFT MT598 messages.
  - Support for four generic MMI categories with specific data fields (e.g., issue date, maturity date, coupon rate).
  - Development of a front-end system for monitoring, manual updates, and reporting.
  - Integration between JSE and STRATE using a new SWIFT BIC branch code.
  - Implementation of a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Service Level Agreement (SLA).

- **Out of scope**:
  - Top-up or reduction of issuance amounts (excluded from current flows).
  - Direct interaction between JSE and MMF participants (only via STRATE).
  - Modifications to existing equity or bond ISIN issuance processes.
  - Non-MMI ISIN services (e.g., equities, bonds).
  - SWIFT message formats other than MT598 (as approved by NMPG).

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As STRATE, I want to request new ISINs so that MMIs can be settled electronically on the same day.
  - As the JSE (NNA), I want to validate and issue ISINs automatically so that STRATE receives immediate confirmations.
  - As a system administrator, I want to monitor rejections and manual overrides so that operational issues are resolved promptly.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Support daily issuance of 200–500 ISINs without manual intervention.
  - Achieve same-day electronic settlement for MMIs through timely ISIN issuance.
  - Maintain compliance with ANNA and ISO 6166 standards for all issued ISINs.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Must use SWIFT MT598 messages with NMPG-approved content.
  - ISIN prefix "ZAM" is reserved for MMIs to distinguish from equities and bonds.
  - All costs for development and operation are to be recovered from STRATE.
  - The system must adhere to ANNA guidelines and JSE market rules.
  - Only one NNA (JSE) is authorized per country per ANNA rules.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Final approval of SWIFT message content by NMPG (pending).
  - Specific error codes for MT598-901/902 rejections (to be defined).
  - Billing methodology for monthly running costs (to be detailed in SLA).
