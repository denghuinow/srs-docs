# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The JSE, as South Africa's National Numbering Agent (NNA), is establishing an automated ISIN issuance system for Money Market Instruments (MMIs) to support the electronic trading and settlement environment being implemented by STRATE. This system will enable electronic creation, amendment, and deletion of ISIN codes for dematerialized MMIs using SWIFT messaging. The scope excludes manual ISIN issuance processes and focuses only on the electronic interface between STRATE and JSE.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
**Roles:** STRATE (initiator), JSE/NNA (processor), MMF Participants (indirect users), Issuers (data providers), CSDPs (settlement agents), JSE Clearing & Settlement (monitoring)

**Main Scenarios:**
- ISIN issuance request and confirmation
- ISIN cancellation/de-issue request and confirmation  
- ISIN deregistration on maturity
- Format validation and rejection handling

## Business Process
**Main Process (ISIN Issuance):**
1. STRATE sends MT598-150 NEWM request
2. JSE validates message format and content
3. JSE generates ISIN with ZAM prefix
4. JSE sends MT598-151 confirmation
5. STRATE validates confirmation
6. ISIN activated in system

**Key Branches:**
- **Rejection Flow:** Invalid format/content → MT598-901/902 → Error notification → Process restart
- **Cancellation Flow:** MT598-150 DISS/MATU → Validation → ISIN status update → Confirmation

## Domain Model
**Entities:**
- ISIN Record (ISIN code: unique, status: required, issue_date: required)
- MMI Instrument (category: required, type: required, issuer_code: required)
- Issuer (participant_code: unique, name: required)
- Transaction (reference: unique, type: required, date: required)
- Coupon Details (rate: conditional, frequency: conditional, payment_day: conditional)
- Maturity Details (date: conditional)
- Issue Details (amount: required, date: required)
- Rejection Record (error_code: required, original_reference: reference)

## Interfaces and Integrations
**SWIFT Interface (JSE ↔ STRATE):**
- Direction: Bidirectional
- Interaction: MT598 message exchange
- Input: ISIN requests, cancellations, confirmations
- Output: ISIN confirmations, rejections
- SLA: Real-time processing, 200-500 ISINs daily capacity

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** a valid MT598-150 NEWM message from STRATE **When** JSE processes the request **Then** a unique ZAM-prefixed ISIN is generated and confirmed via MT598-151

**Given** an invalid message format **When** JSE receives the message **Then** MT598-901 rejection is sent immediately with error details

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance:** Process 500 ISIN requests daily with sub-minute response time
- **Reliability:** 99.5% system availability during business hours
- **Security:** SWIFT BKE compliance, authorized access only
- **Compliance:** ANNA/ISO 6166 standards adherence
- **Observability:** Real-time rejection notifications and daily activity reporting

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. SWIFT message format approval (NMPG/MMF)
2. Development completion and testing
3. SLA finalization with STRATE
4. BCP implementation
5. Production deployment Q2 2004
6. Post-implementation support handover

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Message format changes:** Maintain flexible parsing logic and version control
- **Volume spikes:** Scale capacity to handle 500+ daily requests
- **SWIFT connectivity:** Implement redundant communication channels
- **Data integrity:** Comprehensive validation rules and audit trails
- **Regulatory changes:** Regular ANNA guideline reviews and updates

## Undecided Issues and Responsible Parties
- Final SWIFT message content approval (NMPG/MMF)
- Error code standardization between JSE and STRATE (Joint technical teams)
- Monthly running cost billing methodology (JSE Finance/STRATE)
- BCP detailed procedures (JSE Clearing & Settlement)
- Long-term archiving strategy (Joint operations)
- Participant code management process (STRATE/JSE)
- Front-end access controls (JSE IT)
- Performance monitoring thresholds (Joint operations)
