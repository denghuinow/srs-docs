# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: GOG is a Gaia Object Generator designed to simulate catalog, main database, and final mission data without using actual telemetry or databases. It uses error models to provide rapid simulations of large amounts of astronomical data.

- **In scope**:
  - Source generation from Universe Model or user-provided object catalog
  - Simulation of epoch and combined astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity data
  - Spectrum simulation for RP/BP and RVS instruments
  - Modular and configurable architecture via input configuration file
  - Output formats compliant with Universe Model and Main Database ICDs

- **Out of scope**:
  - Raw data production (focuses on pre-processed data)
  - Overlapping effects modeling between sources
  - Detailed instrumental noise simulation (refer to GIBIS instead)
  - Real-time data processing
  - Platform-specific optimizations

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a data analyst, I want to generate simulated catalog data so that I can test processing pipelines.
  - As a calibration developer, I want configurable noise models so that I can validate calibration algorithms.
  - As a consortium member, I want rapid simulations so that I can access statistically equivalent mission data.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Process one complete source within 2 CPU seconds
  - Generate data for up to 20% of expected final catalog
  - Provide identical results for identical input configurations

- **Major constraints**:
  - Must run on Linux, UNIX, and Mac platforms
  - Built as standalone Java application deployable as JAR
  - Must support command-line and script execution
  - Dependent on evolving error models and Main Database specifications
  - Source-by-source processing only (no relative position effects)

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Future capability for sky region processing and overlapping effects
  - Gradual implementation timeline for instrumental error models
  - Calibration error model availability from Coordination Units
  - Revision requirements based on final Interface Control Documents
