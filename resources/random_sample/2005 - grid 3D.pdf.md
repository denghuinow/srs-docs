# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The project aims to develop a 3D visualization tool for biological data to help users investigate and compare data attributes at a glance, addressing gaps in existing tools.

- **In scope**:
  - Plot data points in a scientifically correct manner.
  - Allow user interaction with data points (select, view details).
  - Support grid manipulation (rotate, zoom, move).
  - Handle up to 2000 data points.
  - Display axis labels and point colors based on input data.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Support for non-tabular data formats.
  - Integration with non-specified external applications.
  - Multi-language user interfaces.
  - Advanced data analysis features.
  - Mobile or non-PC platform deployment.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As an **Identifier**, I want to select data points so that I can identify points of interest.
  - As an **Investigator**, I want to view detailed point information so that I can analyze specific data attributes.
  - As a **Demonstrator**, I want to manipulate the 3D view so that I can present data patterns clearly.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Application starts within 30 seconds.
  - User interactions respond within 2 seconds.
  - Supports plotting and interaction with up to 2000 data points.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Must run on both Windows and Linux.
  - Execution must remain server-side.
  - Must be developed by March 2005 for a research paper.
  - Requires mouse and keyboard as minimum input tools.
  - Users must provide data in specified tab-delimited format.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific deployment tools (Tomcat/Apache/Ant).
  - Minimum workstation hardware specifications.
  - Data file formatting details.
  - Color mapping for cluster numbers.
  - Not mentioned.
