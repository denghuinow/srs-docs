# Ultra Short Summary
- The project aims to establish a statewide e-mail, messaging, and calendaring service for all executive branch agencies to reduce costs and meet legal requirements.

**MVP points**
- Users must be able to send, receive, reply to, and delete e-mail and attachments.
- Users must be able to create and manage calendars, contacts, and distribution lists.
- The system must provide archiving, retention, and discovery capabilities to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
- The system must include security features such as anti-virus protection, content filtering, and encryption.

**Key constraints**
- The proposed plan must be submitted by December 31, 2009.
- The system must meet federal and state requirements for confidentiality, privacy, and security.
- All agencies must migrate to the new system by June 30, 2013.

**Major risks/undecided issues**
- The sourcing option (in-house, external, or combined) is still under analysis.
- The technical and financial feasibility of each functional requirement is still being evaluated.
