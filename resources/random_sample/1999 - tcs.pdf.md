# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
The Tactical Control System (TCS) provides a single command, control, data receipt, processing, export, and dissemination system interoperable with present and future tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It supports five levels of UAV interaction, from data receipt to full flight control, and integrates with numerous C4I systems through an open, scalable architecture compliant with DII/COE standards.

## Roles and User Stories
- **UAV Operator**: I want to control multiple UAVs and payloads simultaneously so that I can conduct reconnaissance and surveillance missions efficiently.
- **Mission Planner**: I want to generate and modify flight routes and payload plans so that missions can adapt to dynamic battlefield conditions.
- **Imagery Analyst**: I want to process and annotate payload imagery in near-real-time so that targets can be identified and coordinates developed accurately.
- **Maintenance Technician**: I want to perform system diagnostics and software upgrades so that system availability and reliability are maintained.
- **C4I System User**: I want to receive UAV data and imagery through standard interfaces so that intelligence can be integrated with other battlefield systems.

## Key Processes
1. **Trigger: Power application** → System enters Startup State, initializes hardware/software, and determines achievable interaction levels.
2. **Trigger: Operator command** → Mission planning function generates flight routes, payload plans, and validates mission parameters.
3. **Trigger: Mission execution** → System controls and monitors UAV flight, payload operation, and data links during mission.
4. **Trigger: Payload data receipt** → System processes, displays, and performs limited exploitation of imagery and sensor data.
5. **Trigger: Target identification** → Targeting function develops coordinates and estimates accuracy for military applications.
6. **Trigger: External tasking** → C4I interface function exchanges tactical messages and imagery with command systems.
7. **Trigger: System fault detection** → Maintenance functions perform diagnostics and support software upgrades.

## Domain Data Elements
- **Mission Plan** (Primary Key: Plan ID) - Waypoints, Payload Commands, Communications Settings, Validity Status
- **Air Vehicle** (Primary Key: AV ID) - Current Position, Telemetry Data, Fuel Status, System Status
- **Payload Product** (Primary Key: Product ID) - Imagery Data, Telemetry, Timestamp, Exploitation Metadata
- **Target Data** (Primary Key: Target ID) - Coordinates, Accuracy Estimate, Classification, Time of Detection
- **C4I Message** (Primary Key: Message ID) - Message Format, Content, Destination System, Transmission Status
- **System Configuration** (Primary Key: Config ID) - Hardware Setup, Software Version, Security Settings, Interface Status

## Non-functional Requirements
- System reliability (MTBF) and maintainability (MTTR) meeting Predator and Outrider ORD specifications
- 50% spare memory capacity and throughput headroom during normal operations
- Operation in worldwide climatic conditions and electromagnetic environments
- Year 2000 compliance for all hardware and software components
- 72-hour continuous operational capability
- Security accreditation for processing classified and sensitive unclassified data

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- Phase 1: 24-month Program Definition and Risk Reduction demonstrating Levels 1-5 interaction
- Phase 2: Engineering and Manufacturing Development with Low Rate Initial Production
- Integration with 20+ C4I systems according to prioritized implementation schedule
- Compliance with DII/COE, JTA, CIGSS, NITF, and VMF standards
- Dependency on NIMA for digitized map data and terrain elevation information

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Single point failures causing unsafe UAV commands** → Redundant design with no single hardware/software failure resulting in unsafe commands
- **Interoperability challenges with multiple UAV types** → AV Standard Interface providing generic architecture for future expansion
- **Security vulnerabilities in multi-system integration** → Risk assessment and compliance with DoD security directives
- **Electromagnetic interference in tactical environments** → EMI control techniques and compatibility testing
- **Loss of link during critical mission phases** → Automatic reestablishment procedures and estimated position computation

## Undecided Issues
- Specific electromagnetic environment values for service-specific operations
- Radiation hazard (RADHAZ) and HERO values determination
- Nuclear safety requirements consideration
- Privacy requirements applicability
- Software reusability requirements
- Usability quality factor specifications
