# Software Requirements Specification
## For
# High Assurance Transformation System (HATS) Graphical User Interface (GUI)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 15, 2001  
**Status:** Draft

***

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the High Assurance Transformation System (HATS) Graphical User Interface (GUI). The purpose of this software is to provide a platform-independent, user-friendly interface that simplifies interaction with the transformation-based software development tools of the HATS system. This SRS is intended for the project managers, developers, and testers involved in the implementation and verification of the HATS GUI.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The HATS GUI will be a standalone application that acts as a front-end to the HATS transformation engine (HATS-SML). It will allow users to manage transformation projects, visualize code structures as Syntax Derivation Trees (SDTs), execute transformation programs, and view the results. The core value is abstracting the command-line complexity of HATS-SML into an intuitive graphical environment, thereby increasing productivity and reducing the learning curve for new users.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

### 1.5 Overview
The remainder of this document is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overall description of the product, including its perspective, functions, and constraints. Section 3 details the specific functional and non-functional requirements.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The HATS GUI is a new, self-contained component that interfaces with the existing HATS-SML backend engine. The relationship is that of a master (GUI) and slave (HATS-SML engine). The GUI will invoke the HATS-SML compiler and executor as external processes, parsing their outputs to present results to the user.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The high-level functions of the HATS GUI MVP are:
1.  **Application Management:** Create, delete, and manage HATS "applications," which are logical containers for transformation programs and target files.
2.  **Source Parsing and Visualization:** Parse transformation language programs and target files into SDTs and display them in a navigable tree view.
3.  **Transformation Execution:** Execute a selected transformation program on a selected target file using the HATS-SML engine.
4.  **Result Display and Navigation:** Display the resulting SDT and the pretty-printed text output of the transformation. Provide search and selection features within these views.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The intended users are software developers and engineers with knowledge of formal methods and program transformation. They are technically proficient but require a more efficient workflow than a pure command-line interface offers.

### 2.4 Constraints
1.  **Implementation Language:** The application must be implemented in Java.
2.  **Platform Independence:** The compiled application must run identically, without code modification, on the following operating systems:
    *   Microsoft Windows 2000
    *   Sun Solaris
    *   Linux
3.  **Schedule:** All development and testing must be completed by December 2001.
4.  **User Interface Design:** The application must minimize the number of simultaneously open windows and dialog boxes to prevent user interface clutter and confusion.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
*   **Critical Dependency:** The successful development of this GUI is dependent on the timely release and functional stability of HATS-SML version 2.0, which is assumed to be available by October 2001. Any delay in HATS-SML 2.0 will directly impact the project schedule.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 External Interface Requirements

#### 3.1.1 User Interfaces
*   The main window shall be a Single Document Interface (SDI) or a well-managed Multiple Document Interface (MDI) to adhere to the constraint of minimizing open windows.
*   It shall contain a main menu bar with standard items (File, Edit, View, Tools, Help).
*   A project/application explorer pane shall be present for navigating files and associations.
*   A central multi-tabbed pane shall be used to display SDT views, pretty-printed text, and other content.
*   Context menus shall be available for relevant UI elements (e.g., files in the project explorer).

#### 3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces
*   The software shall not require any specific hardware other than a standard display, keyboard, and mouse.

#### 3.1.3 Software Interfaces
*   **HATS-SML Engine:** The GUI shall call the HATS-SML command-line executable (e.g., `hats-smlexec`) to perform parsing and transformation execution.
*   **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** The application shall require a JRE version 1.3 or higher to be installed on the host system.

#### 3.1.4 Communications Interfaces
*   Not applicable for this version. All communication with HATS-SML is via local process execution.

### 3.2 Functional Requirements

    *   **Input:** User selects a transformation program and a target file (e.g., via right-click context menu) and chooses "Execute."
    *   **Processing:** The system shall invoke the HATS-SML executor with the appropriate parameters.
    *   **Output:** The system displays a progress indicator and, upon completion, the results are displayed (see FR-RD).

#### 3.2.4 Result Display and Navigation (FR-RD)

*   **FR-RD-1: Display Result SDT**
