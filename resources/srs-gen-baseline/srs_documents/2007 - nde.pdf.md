## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed description of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the NPOESS Data Exploitation (NDE) System. It specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for the system, serving as an agreement between the developers and the stakeholders, including NOAA and its civilian users. This SRS is intended for use by the project managers, developers, testers, and system architects involved in the implementation and verification of the NDE system.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The NDE system is a critical data processing and distribution infrastructure designed to ingest, process, archive, and disseminate environmental data products derived from NPP (National Polar-orbiting Partnership) and NPOESS (National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System) satellite observations. The primary goal is to transform raw satellite data into NOAA-unique and tailored environmental data products and deliver them to authorized users within specified latency requirements. The system will also provide essential customer support services.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **NDE**: NPOESS Data Exploitation
- **NPP**: National Polar-orbiting Partnership
- **NPOESS**: National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System
- **NOAA**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
- **CLASS**: Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (long-term archive)
- **ESPC**: Enterprise Security and Privacy Controls
- **TB**: Terabyte
- **Latency**: The time delay between data observation by the satellite and its delivery to the end-user.
- **Data Denial Plan**: A protocol for restricting data access under specific, predefined conditions.

### 1.4 References
- Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework
- NOAA ESPC Security Procedures and Guidelines
- NPOESS System Architecture Document
- CLASS Archive Interface Control Document

### 1.5 Document Overview
The remainder of this document describes the overall system, its features, and detailed requirements in sections 2 through 5.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The NDE system is a major component within the larger NOAA satellite data processing ecosystem. It interfaces with upstream systems that provide raw NPP and NPOESS satellite data and downstream systems, including the CLASS archive and various user distribution networks. It operates as a standalone system but must integrate seamlessly within the prescribed Federal Enterprise Architecture.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The core functions of the NDE system are:
1.  **Data Product Generation:** Process NPOESS observations to generate NOAA-unique and tailored environmental data products.
2.  **Data Distribution:** Deliver generated data products to authorized NOAA and civilian users.
3.  **Data Archival:** Archive all NOAA-unique data products to the CLASS long-term archive.
4.  **User Management:** Provide user registration, authentication, and authorization services.
5.  **Customer Support:** Operate a help desk to assist users with system access, data requests, and technical issues.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- **NOAA Scientists & Analysts:** Expert users who require specialized, high-quality environmental data for forecasting and research.
- **Civilian Users:** A diverse group including researchers, educators, and commercial entities who access data through public portals.
- **System Administrators:** Technical staff responsible for system operation, monitoring, and maintenance.
- **Help Desk Staff:** Personnel who provide front-line support to end-users.

### 2.4 Constraints
- **Architectural Compliance:** The system must comply with the Federal Enterprise Architecture.
- **Security Compliance:** All system components and procedures must adhere to ESPC security standards.
- **Regulatory:** Must operate under relevant U.S. government data policies and regulations.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Assumption:** NPP and NPOESS satellite data feeds will be available and conform to expected data formats and delivery schedules.
- **Dependency:** The system is dependent on the availability and performance of the external CLASS archive system for long-term data storage.
- **Dependency:** The system relies on stable network connectivity for high-volume data transfer.

## 3. System Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Data Ingestion and Processing**
- **FR-1.1:** The system shall ingest raw satellite data from NPP and NPOESS sources.
- **FR-1.2:** The system shall generate NOAA-unique data products as defined in the product generation algorithms.
- **FR-1.3:** The system shall support both scheduled (e.g., routine passes) and event-driven (e.g., severe weather) processing tasks.

**FR-2: Data Distribution**
- **FR-2.1:** The system shall distribute data products to authorized users via specified protocols (e.g., HTTPS, FTP).
- **FR-2.2:** The system shall deliver data products within user-specific latency requirements as defined in the operational procedures.
- **FR-2.3:** The system shall enforce user access controls during data distribution.

**FR-3: Data Archival**
- **FR-3.1:** The system shall transmit all NOAA-unique data products to the CLASS archive.
- **FR-3.2:** The system shall verify successful transmission and integrity of data archived in CLASS.

**FR-4: User and Customer Services**
- **FR-4.1:** The system shall provide a user registration portal for account creation and management.
- **FR-4.2:** The system shall provide a help desk interface for submitting and tracking support requests.
- **FR-4.3:** The system shall notify users of system status, outages, and new product availability.

### 3.2 External Interface Requirements

**EI-1: Satellite Data Feed Interface**
- The system shall interface with the NPP/NPOESS data downlink and processing centers to receive Level 0 or Level 1 data.

**EI-2: CLASS Archive Interface**
- The system shall use the standard API or data transfer protocol defined by the CLASS system for archival.

**EI-3: User Access Interface**
- The system shall provide a web-based portal and API for user access, data search, and retrieval.

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Scalability**
- The system architecture shall be scalable to handle input and output data volumes ranging from 8 TB/day to 16 TB/day across different mission eras without significant architectural changes.

**NFR-2: Reliability**
- The system shall maintain a 99% reliability rate for the successful completion of all scheduled and event-driven processing and distribution tasks over a monthly period.

**NFR-3: Security**
- The system shall implement robust authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms in compliance with ESPC security procedures.

## 4. Other Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance Requirements
- **Latency:** Data delivery times shall not exceed the maximum latencies defined for each data product category (e.g., Near-Real-Time, Real-Time).
- **Throughput:** The system must sustain the processing and distribution of peak data volumes (16 TB/day) without creating a backlog that violates latency requirements.
- **Availability:** The system shall target an operational availability of 99.5%.

### 4.2 Safety and Security Requirements
- All user data and system access must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- The system shall support a "restricted access mode" as part of a Data Denial Plan.

### 4.3 Software Quality Attributes
- **Maintainability:** The system shall be designed with modular components to facilitate easy updates and maintenance.
- **Usability:** User interfaces for data access and the help desk shall be intuitive and require minimal training.

### 5.1 Open Issues
- None identified at this time.

### 5.2 To Be Determined (TBD)
- **TBD-1:** The specific criteria and triggers for activating the "restricted access mode" as part of the Data Denial Plan have not been defined and are pending input from NOAA security and policy teams.
