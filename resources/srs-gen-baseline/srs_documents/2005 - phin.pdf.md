## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the Public Health Event Management System (PHEMS). The purpose of this system is to provide a comprehensive software solution for public health agencies to investigate, monitor, manage, analyze, and report on public health outbreaks and bioterrorism events. This SRS will serve as the definitive guide for stakeholders and the development team throughout the project lifecycle.

### 1.2 Document Conventions
- Requirements are specified using the structure outlined in this template.
- Key terms are **bolded** upon first use and defined in the glossary.
- Functional requirements are listed under each system feature with a unique ID (e.g., FR-1.1).

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
- **Project Managers & Stakeholders:** Should focus on Sections 1 (Introduction), 2 (Overall Description), and 3 (System Features) to understand project scope and capabilities.
- **Developers & System Architects:** Should read the entire document, with particular attention to Sections 2.5 (Constraints), 3 (System Features), 4 (External Interfaces), and 5 (Non-Functional Requirements).
- **QA & Testers:** Should use Section 3 (System Features) and Section 5 (Non-Functional Requirements) to derive test cases.

### 1.4 Project Scope
The PHEMS is a centralized platform designed to replace or integrate disparate data collection and management tools used during public health crises. It will enable the seamless collection, linkage, and analysis of case, contact, laboratory, and exposure data. The system's core value is its flexibility, allowing for rapid adaptation to different health events (e.g., infectious disease outbreaks, foodborne illnesses, bioterrorism attacks) through configurable data fields and workflows.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
PHEMS is envisioned as a standalone but interoperable web application. It may need to interface with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, laboratory information management systems (LIMS), and other public health surveillance systems.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The high-level functions of PHEMS are:
1.  **Data Ingestion & Management:** Collect and maintain core entities (Cases, Contacts, etc.).
2.  **Flexible Data Modeling:** Allow administrators to define event-specific data schemas.
3.  **Epidemiological Investigation:** Facilitate contact tracing and visualize transmission chains.
4.  **Situational Awareness:** Generate reports, dashboards, and visualizations for decision-makers.
5.  **Resilient Operation:** Function in both connected and disconnected environments.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
| User Class | Characteristics | Key Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Field Investigator** | Mobile user, may have limited connectivity. | Enter case/contact data, conduct interviews in the field. |
| **Epidemiologist/Analyst** | Public health expert, data-savvy. | Analyze data, create visualizations, generate reports, map transmission. |
| **Public Health Manager** | Decision-maker, needs high-level overview. | Monitor event status, manage resources, view summary reports. |
| **System Administrator** | IT expert. | Configure user roles, manage system settings, define questionnaires. |

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Software:** Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). A mobile-responsive design is required.
- **Servers:** Application and database servers supporting a cloud, on-premise, or hybrid deployment.
- **Mobile:** Capability for offline data storage and subsequent synchronization on mobile devices (e.g., tablets, laptops).

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
1.  **Interoperability Constraint:** The system **must** use established healthcare vocabularies (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED CT) and data exchange standards (e.g., HL7 FHIR) for all external data interfaces.
2.  **Security Constraint:** The system **must** implement robust security controls to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, protecting against unauthorized access as per relevant regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
3.  **Deployment Constraint:** The system architecture **must** support multiple deployment modes, including a fully disconnected mode for field operations with secure data synchronization capabilities when a connection is restored.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Assumption:** Users will be trained on the specific public health workflows and the use of the PHEMS application.
- **Assumption:** Adequate hardware and network infrastructure will be available for the deployment environment.
- **Dependency:** Availability and stability of chosen standards (HL7 FHIR) and terminology servers.
