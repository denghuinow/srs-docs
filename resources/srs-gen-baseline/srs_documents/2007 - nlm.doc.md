## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Digital Repository. This system is designed to be an OAIS-compliant digital repository for the acquisition, preservation, and long-term access of NLM's digital biomedical collections. The intended audience for this document includes project stakeholders, system architects, developers, testers, and project managers.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The NLM Digital Repository will provide a sustainable, secure, and standards-compliant infrastructure for managing the lifecycle of digital assets. The core mission is to ensure the long-term viability, authenticity, and accessibility of digital biomedical information. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on foundational OAIS functions: Ingest, Archival Storage, Data Management, and Access.

Out-of-scope for the MVP are advanced data analysis tools, public-facing web portals with complex user interaction features, and digitization services.

### 1.5 Document Overview
This document is organized to first provide a high-level description of the system and its constraints, followed by detailed specifications of system features, interfaces, and non-functional requirements.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The NLM Digital Repository is a new system that must operate within the existing NLM IT ecosystem. It will function as a "back-end" preservation service, interacting with other systems such as the public access catalog and internal workflow tools. It is not intended to replace the public-facing search interface but to serve as the authoritative source for preserved digital content.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The high-level functions of the system are:
1. **Ingest**: Accept digital materials in various formats and transform them into Archival Information Packages (AIPs).
2. **Preservation**: Ensure the long-term integrity and usability of AIPs through fixity checks, format migration, and replication.
3. **Data Management**: Store, manage, and link all descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata.
4. **Access**: Provide authorized users with the ability to search, discover, and retrieve digital objects.
5. **Administration**: Manage user accounts, permissions, system policies, and audit trails.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

| User Class           | Characteristics                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Depositor**        | Internal staff who submit digital materials for ingestion. Requires guided workflow tools. |
| **Archivist**        | Manages the repository, monitors ingest and preservation processes, and handles exceptions. |
| **Researcher**       | External or internal user who needs to discover and access preserved materials. Has read-only access. |
| **System Admin**     | IT staff responsible for system health, user management, and integration with other systems. |
| **Public User**      | Anonymous user with access to a subset of publicly available materials.         |

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Software:** The repository will likely be built upon an existing digital repository platform (e.g., Fedora Commons, DSpace, or a commercial solution) running on a Linux-based operating system.
- **Database:** A robust RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL) or triplestore for metadata.
- **Storage:** A hybrid storage architecture, including high-performance disk for active work and low-cost, durable object storage (e.g., Amazon S3, on-premise Ceph) for AIPs.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
1. **Compliance:** The system **must** be compliant with the OAIS reference model.
2. **Integration:** The system **must** integrate with the existing NLM Integrated Library System (ILS) for metadata synchronization and discovery.
3. **Security:** The system **must** adhere to all HHS and NIH security standards for data classification, access control, and auditing.
4. **Technology:** The final technology stack is dependent on the ongoing evaluation of software options (e.g., Samvera, Fedora, Archivematica).

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Assumption:** Adequate budget and staffing will be secured for the implementation phase.
- **Assumption:** Necessary digital preservation policies (e.g., format migration strategies, ingest criteria) will be finalized prior to full-scale implementation.
- **Dependency:** The project's timeline and feature set are dependent on the successful evaluation and selection of a core repository software platform.
- **Dependency:** Functionality is dependent on stable APIs from the existing ILS.

## 3. System Features
*This section details the functional requirements. Each requirement is uniquely identified (e.g., FR-ING-01).*

### 3.1 Ingest Management
**Description:** This feature covers the process of accepting digital content and preparing it for preservation.

**Requirements:**
- **FR-ING-01:** The system shall accept Submission Information Packages (SIPs) containing digital files and associated metadata.
