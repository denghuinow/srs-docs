      "title": "SRS: Purpose & Scope: The XRT Control Processor (XCP) flight software manages the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT), a sensitive CCD imaging spectrometer that refines BAT position data to 2.5\" within 5 seconds of target acquisition. The system processes science data from the camera, transmits telemetry to the spacecraft, and controls critical subsystems including heaters and the Telescope Alignment Monitor. It does not handle spacecraft attitude control or scientific data analysis.\n\nProduct Background / Positioning: The XRT is a key instrument on the Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer mission, one of three semi-autonomous instruments (alongside BAT and UVOT) for multi-wavelength transient astronomy. It reuses components from previous projects (CUBIC, IMAGE, JET-X, XMM) and interfaces with the spacecraft via MIL-STD-1553B to enable rapid GRB afterglow observations.\n\nCore Functional Overview: \n- Process science data from camera and relay to spacecraft as CCSDS packets\n- Receive commands from spacecraft to establish instrument state\n- Transmit housekeeping telemetry within 230-byte constraints\n- Synchronize local clock with spacecraft using 1PPS\n- Control telescope tube and baffle heaters via closed-loop control\n- Read and process Telescope Alignment Monitor data\n- Support three observation sequences (Automatic, Preplanned, Target of Opportunity)\n- Operate in multiple science modes including Image, Photo-Diode, Windowed Timing, and Photon Counting\n\nKey Users & Usage Scenarios: Ground-based mission operators at the Science Mission Operations Center (SMOC) command the system via telecommands. The spacecraft autonomously executes observations when BAT detects GRBs, with ground operators adjusting parameters for specific observation types and science modes.\n\nMajor External Interfaces: MIL-STD-1553B bus for spacecraft communication, RS-422 for Telescope Alignment Monitor, analog I/O for housekeeping telemetry, and engineering Ethernet for development. All interfaces must comply with spacecraft constraints including 230-byte packet limits.\n\nKey Non-functional Requirements: Must operate within strict real-time constraints for GRB response (position refinement within 5 seconds), maintain reliability with no single point of failure, support error detection/correction for memory, and operate within TDRSS downlink bandwidth limit of 1 kbps for telemetry.\n\nConstraints, Assumptions & Dependencies: Malindi ground contacts limited to ~7 per day (7-10 minutes each), spacecraft does not reassemble segmented packets, ITOS ground system cannot decompress packets, and spacecraft HK packets must be ≤230 bytes. The system must operate with limited power from spacecraft 28VDC buses (OPB and SPB).\n\nPriorities & Acceptance Approach: Mission success (GRB detection and afterglow study) is highest priority. Acceptance requires successful GRB position refinement within 5 seconds, telemetry within 1 kbps bandwidth limit, and system operation across all science modes with required error handling. Primary verification occurs through ground testing and on-orbit observation of known GRB events."

      "title": "SRS: Purpose & Scope  \nThis system extends agentMom to enable secure broadcasting, multicasting, and unicast communication in multi-agent systems. It handles message delivery within local networks (broadcast), predefined agent groups (multicast), and direct agent pairs (unicast). It does not guarantee message delivery, provide advanced security beyond encryption, or support non-local network broadcasting.  \n\nProduct Background / Positioning  \nThe system integrates as a Java-based communication framework within multi-agent applications, building on agentMom 1.2. It replaces unicast-only communication with enhanced modes while maintaining compatibility with existing agentMom 1.2 implementations.  \n\nCore Functional Overview  \n- Broadcast messages to all agents in the local network.  \n- Multicast messages to agents subscribed to a specific group address.  \n- Unicast messages to individual agents within an organization.  \n- Agent choice between broadcast, multicast, or unicast communication modes.  \n- Join/leave multicast groups dynamically.  \n- Toggle encryption for all message types.  \n- Set multicast TTL and group addresses.  \n\nKey Users & Usage Scenarios  \nUsers are Java developers with multi-agent systems experience. Agents must know destination addresses (unicast), multicast group addresses, or local network context to send messages. Scenarios include task completion notifications (multicast), new agent announcements (broadcast), and direct agent coordination (unicast).  \n\nMajor External Interfaces  \nRequires TCP/IP for unicast, multicast protocol for group messaging, and UDP for broadcast. Interfaces with network infrastructure (routers, OS) supporting multicast and broadcast.  \n\nKey Non-functional Requirements  \nMulticast/broadcast packets delivered best-effort (no guarantee of delivery). Broadcast messages restricted to system administrators. Multicast requires network support (routers, OS, NIC).  \n\nConstraints, Assumptions & Dependencies  \nMulticast delivery depends on network infrastructure support. Broadcast restricted to administrators. Agents must know destination addresses for unicast and multicast groups. Security relies on basic encryption with no guarantee against decryption.  \n\nPriorities & Acceptance Approach  \nMust-haves: Core communication modes (broadcast/multicast/unicast), encryption toggle, group join/leave, and agent compatibility. Acceptance requires demonstration of all \"driving requirements\" (asterisked in SRS)."

It manages applications, parses transformation language programs and target files, executes transformations, and displays SDT and pretty-printed outputs. It does not implement transformation logic (handled by HATS-SML) or manage HATS-SML installation.\n\n**Product Background / Positioning**:  \nHATS-GUI is a Java-based GUI delivered with HATS to increase adoption by the transformation and research community. It addresses limitations of the prototype, which lacked portability and adequate output display, enabling broader user experimentation and feedback for HATS development.\n\n**Core Functional Overview**:  \n- Application management (create, open, save, delete)  \n- Parsing of transformation language programs and target files  \n- Execution of transformation language programs  \n- Display and manipulation of SDT outputs  \n- Display and manipulation of pretty-printed text outputs  \n- Configuration of SDT display settings (colors, shapes, expansion levels)  \n- Search functionality for SDTs and text  \n\n**Key Users & Usage Scenarios**:  \nSophisticated users with expertise in transformation-based software development. They prepare applications, execute transformations, examine outputs, and configure display settings. No extensive help messages are required due to user expertise.\n\n**Major External Interfaces**:  \n- HATS-SML (version 2.0) for transformation services  \n- Host OS (Windows 2000, Solaris, Linux) for file services and process execution  \n- Menu-driven user interface with specific menu structure  \n\n**Key Non-functional Requirements**:  \n- Performance: Display 10,000-node SDTs in ≤5 seconds; display 1,000,000-node SDTs in same time plus/minus 2 seconds  \n- Platform independence: Run on Windows 2000, Solaris, and Linux without code modifications  \n- Concurrent operations: Allow user to continue working while transformations execute  \n- Memory efficiency: Avoid unacceptable SDT display algorithms  \n\n**Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies**:  \n- JVM and ML interpreter must be installed  \n- HATS-SML version 2.0 must be available by October 2001  \n- HATS runs on same system as HATS-GUI  \n- Single-user at a time  \n- Hierarchical file system required  \n\n**Priorities & Acceptance Approach**:  \nPlatform independence and performance metrics are critical success factors. Acceptance requires meeting SDT display performance targets across all supported platforms, with concurrent operation capability as a hard constraint."

      "title": "SRS: Purpose & Scope: Clarus is a U.S. DOT initiative to create a network for collecting, quality checking, and sharing surface transportation environmental data (atmospheric, pavement, and hydrologic). It provides a one-stop portal for environmental observations, enables continuous quality checking with feedback to data providers, and supports integration with existing weather data sources. The system does not handle long-term data archiving or replace existing operational systems.\n\nProduct Background / Positioning: Clarus positions itself as the next step in integrating surface transportation weather observations with broader weather community efforts. It serves as a network connecting independent data collection systems to enhance data coverage, improve meteorological support services, and provide guidance to data source owners regarding data quality. The system is designed to be open and standards-based, using non-proprietary interfaces.\n\nCore Functional Overview: \n- Collect environmental data from diverse sources (ESS, vehicles, cameras)\n- Apply automated and manual quality checking with flags\n- Publish data with quality flags through standardized interfaces\n- Manage data sharing agreements between providers and consumers\n- Support spatial and temporal queries for data retrieval\n- Disseminate data within 20 minutes of receipt\n- Handle 300 simultaneous data requests\n\nKey Users & Usage Scenarios: Primary users include state DOTs, weather service providers (NOAA, private), research organizations, and transportation operators. Key usage scenarios involve real-time data access for operational decisions, quality checking feedback to data providers, integration with forecasting models, and support for value-added weather products. Data sharing agreements determine access rights for each user group.\n\nMajor External Interfaces: Interfaces with environmental sensor stations (using NTCIP 1204 standard), weather service providers (e.g., ASOS/AWOS), and data contributors. Uses standard Internet protocols for data dissemination. Data must include location, timestamp, and source metadata with UTC time reference.\n\nKey Non-functional Requirements: Must publish new data within 20 minutes of receipt, respond to data requests within one minute, handle 300 simultaneous requests, complete automated quality checks within 10 seconds, support 470 million current observations, and maintain 24x7 operations. System must use non-proprietary interfaces and be standards-based.\n\nConstraints, Assumptions & Dependencies: System is not critical to existing operations (not a national security mission). Requires data sharing agreements for all data providers. Data must follow NTCIP 1204 standards. Timestamps must use UTC. System must support data from across North America (US, Canada, Mexico). Data must include location, timestamp, and source metadata.\n\nPriorities & Acceptance Approach: Top priority is timeliness (20-minute data publication, 1-minute response time). Secondary priority is quality checking (10-second automated checks). Acceptance requires meeting performance metrics and implementing standardized interfaces. System must be available 24x7 with reliable recovery from failures."
