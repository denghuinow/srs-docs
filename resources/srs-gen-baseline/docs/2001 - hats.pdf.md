## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for HATS-GUI, a platform-independent graphical interface for the High Assurance Transformation System (HATS). The SRS serves as a contract between developers and stakeholders, ensuring all parties have a common understanding of the system's capabilities and constraints.

### 1.2 Scope
HATS-GUI provides a comprehensive graphical interface that simplifies user interaction with transformation-based software development. The system manages applications, parses transformation programs, executes transformations, and displays both SDT (Syntax Directed Translation) and pretty-printed outputs.

**Out of Scope:**
- Implementation of transformation logic (handled by HATS-SML)
- Management of HATS-SML installation
- Multi-user support
- Extensive help system or tutorials

### 1.3 Definitions & Acronyms
