## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the X-38 Fault Tolerant System Services (FTSS), which provides fault-tolerant computing and communication services for NASA's X-38 Crew Return Vehicle Flight Critical Computer. The FTSS enables quad-redundant operation and Byzantine-resilient message passing between virtual processor groups.

### 1.2 Scope
The FTSS software system operates on the Radstone PowerPC 604R hardware platform and provides:
- Fault-tolerant initialization and configuration
- Deterministic task scheduling
- Inter-processor communication services
- Fault detection and isolation capabilities

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms

| Acronym | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| FTSS | Fault Tolerant System Services |
| FCP | Flight Critical Processor |
| ICP | Instrumentation and Control Processor |
| Byzantine Resilience | Tolerance to arbitrary component failures |
| VPG | Virtual Processor Group |
