# Balanced Summary

**Goals and Scope**  
The I-15 Reversible Lane Control System (RLCS) application software will replace the existing aging system to manage the opening and closing of reversible lanes during peak traffic hours and special events. It will interface with new field hardware components and support monitoring, control, sequencing, data processing, and reporting functions. The system aims to enhance traffic management while ensuring safety and reliability.

**Roles and User Stories**  
- *Operator*: I want to issue control commands so that I can open or close lanes during normal operations.  
- *Management*: I want to generate status and summary reports so that I can oversee system performance.  
- *Field Maintenance Staff*: I want to execute maintenance mode control sequences so that I can perform repairs without disrupting normal operations.  
- *System Administrator*: I want to configure system parameters and user accounts so that I can maintain security and adapt to changes.  
- *Software Systems Staff*: I want to access system logs and reports so that I can troubleshoot and ensure software integrity.

**Key Processes**  
1. *Trigger: System startup* – Identify and initialize all control units and device sensors.  
2. *Trigger: Scheduled time or operator command* – Execute stored operational sequences for opening or closing lanes.  
3. *Trigger: Device status polling* – Monitor field device status and update the database every 2 seconds.  
4. *Trigger: Alarm condition detected* – Notify the operator and log critical or warning alarms.  
5. *Trigger: Operator command* – Validate and process control commands against safety rules.  
6. *Trigger: User login* – Authenticate users and grant appropriate command control privileges.  
7. *Trigger: External system request* – Export system status data to an external server every 30 seconds.

**Domain Data Elements**  
- *Device*: Device ID (primary key), Name, Device Status ID, Location ID, Last Maintenance Date  
- *System Operational Command*: Command ID (primary key), Name, Description, Timeout, Command Level  
- *Personnel*: Personnel ID (primary key), Name, Password, Security Level, Status  
- *Alarm Type*: Alarm Type ID (primary key), Description, Criteria  
- *System Mode*: Mode ID (primary key), Name, Parameters  
- *Workstation*: Workstation ID (primary key), Name, Location, Access Level

**Non-Functional Requirements**  
- Availability: 24/7 operation with 99.99% uptime and ≤10-minute recovery from failures.  
- Performance: GUI updates within 2 seconds; device status polling every 2 seconds.  
- Security: Encrypted passwords and rules; role-based access control.  
- Reliability: Continuous operation for 30 days without reset; redundant capabilities for degraded mode.  
- Maintainability: Modular, scalable architecture supporting remote administration.  
- Safety: Multi-layered command screening to prevent conflicting lane directions.

**Milestones and External Dependencies**  
- Finalize RLCS architecture design before high-level software design phase.  
- Deployment of Fiber Optic Network along the I-15 corridor.  
- Integration with external systems (e.g., ATMS, ValuePricing) via external server data store.  
- Replacement of existing controllers with modern units (e.g., 2070 ATC).  
- Successful system testing during facility closure before disconnecting the legacy system.

**Risks and Mitigation Strategies**  
- *Risk: Conflicting lane openings causing safety hazards* – Mitigation: Implement multi-layered safety screening and device interlocks.  
- *Risk: Hardware or communication failures* – Mitigation: Design redundant control paths and degraded mode operations.  
- *Risk: Unauthorized system access* – Mitigation: Use encrypted passwords, role-based security, and integrity checks.  
- *Risk: Device sensor failures during sequences* – Mitigation: Allow operator overrides with strict security controls.  
- *Risk: Software/data corruption in field units* – Mitigation: Employ hash-based integrity verification (e.g., MD5).

**Undecided Issues**  
- Specific intelligent controller model for field device interfacing.  
- Final selection of commercial off-the-shelf software for database and reporting.  
- Detailed validity checks for inputs and abnormal situation responses.  
- Exact thresholds for alarm conditions (e.g., air pressure, temperature).  
- Expansion limits for additional DCU controllers and devices.  
- Not mentioned.
