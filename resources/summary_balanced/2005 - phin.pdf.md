# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
The system supports outbreak management by aiding investigation, monitoring, analysis, and reporting of health events or bioterrorism acts. It aims to collect and analyze data to identify and contain health events, and must be configurable for different event types. The system should integrate with early detection, countermeasure, laboratory, and surveillance systems to manage and mitigate event impacts.

## Roles and User Stories
- **Investigator**: I want to create electronic questionnaires so that I can collect standardized case and exposure data.
- **Laboratory Technician**: I want to link specimen results to cases so that laboratory data unambiguously supports investigations.
- **Public Health Official**: I want to generate outbreak visualizations so that I can analyze transmission patterns and containment effectiveness.
- **Field Worker**: I want to use disconnected data collection so that I can record information remotely and sync when reconnected.
- **System Administrator**: I want to configure entity types and relationships so that the system adapts to new investigation needs.

## Key Processes
1. **Trigger: Health event identification** – Assign a unique event ID and capture initial event details.
2. Create and configure investigation-specific electronic questionnaires for data collection.
3. Collect demographic, exposure, travel, and clinical data for all involved entities.
4. Trace and link contacts, exposures, and relationships between entities.
5. Request laboratory tests and process results, linking them to specimens and subjects.
6. Monitor cases and contacts for symptoms, treatment compliance, and isolation status.
7. Generate analysis, visualizations, and reports for internal and inter-jurisdictional use.

## Domain Data Elements
- **Entity**: Subject ID, Type (Person/Animal/Location), Name, Demographics, Travel History
- **Health Event**: Event ID, Category, Start Date, Suspected Agent, Status
- **Case**: Case ID, Diagnosis, Symptom Onset, Status (Confirmed/Probable), Investigation Dates
- **Exposure Contact**: Contact ID, Exposure Type, Source Entity, Dates, Health Status
- **Specimen/Sample**: Specimen ID, Subject ID, Collection Date, Type, Risk Indicator
- **Laboratory Result**: Result ID, Specimen ID, Test Date, Result Value, Interpretation

## Non-functional Requirements
- Support multiple deployment options (client-server, disconnected, web-based)
- Ensure data synchronization across disconnected instances
- Use standardized vocabularies (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED) for data exchange
- Protect data from unauthorized access and corruption
- Maintain availability during system outages with continuity plans
- Support configurable data fields and entity types

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- Integration with laboratory systems for test orders and results
- Compliance with PHIN message implementation guides for data exchange
- Coordination with surveillance and early event detection systems
- Adoption of vocabulary standards from recognized organizations
- Development of agent-specific deployment packages and libraries

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Data redundancy across cases and exposures** – Implement entity-linking to avoid duplicate demographic capture.
- **Unambiguous identification of animals/objects** – Use tagging and detailed descriptors.
- **Cross-jurisdictional investigation conflicts** – Define clear reporting protocols and data sharing agreements.
- **System unavailability during outbreaks** – Establish backup procedures and offline capabilities.
- **Dynamic investigation data needs** – Allow configurable fields and questionnaires.

## Undecided Issues
- Specific backup and recovery technical implementation
- Detailed interoperability protocols with non-PHIN systems
- Training curriculum and rollout schedule for personnel
- Funding allocation for multi-jurisdictional deployments
- Legal frameworks for inter-state data sharing
