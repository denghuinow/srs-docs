# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
The DUAP System is a research prototype for the Michigan Department of Transportation to evaluate Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) data utility for transportation management. It focuses on collecting, processing, and disseminating vehicle probe, traffic, and weather data to enhance safety, mobility, and asset management. The system serves as a functional demonstration platform rather than a permanent operational system.

## Roles and User Stories
- **Transportation Agency Operator**: I want real-time incident alerts so that I can minimize traffic impact.
- **System Administrator**: I want to manage service configurations so that I can maintain system operations.
- **Maintainer**: I want pothole location data so that I can prioritize road repairs.
- **Traveler**: I want traffic condition information so that I can plan alternative routes.
- **Researcher**: I want archived probe data so that I can analyze transportation patterns.

## Key Processes
1. **Trigger**: Data receipt from external sources → Collect probe, traffic, and weather data via input services.
2. Cache incoming data in dynamic storage with source, location, and timestamp.
3. Apply computational algorithms to derive traffic metrics and incident detection.
4. Archive processed data in persistent storage for long-term analysis.
5. Format analyzed data into standardized outputs (e.g., SAE J2354).
6. Present information through web interfaces for user access.
7. **Trigger**: Administrative action → Configure and monitor system services.

## Domain Data Elements
- **Probe Data** (Primary Key: Segment Number + Timestamp): Vehicle speed, location, heading, brake status.
- **Traffic Data** (Primary Key: Link ID): Speed, occupancy, lane status, volume.
- **Weather Data** (Primary Key: Station ID + Timestamp): Temperature, precipitation, visibility, wind speed.
- **Incident Data** (Primary Key: Incident ID): Type, severity, location, status.
- **Road Condition** (Primary Key: Segment ID): Surface status, ice thickness, treatment data.
- **System Configuration** (Primary Key: Service ID): Parameters, user rights, interface settings.

## Non-functional Requirements
- Support near real-time data processing with latency tolerance.
- Conform to Michigan Department of Information Technology standards.
- Ensure system scalability for adding new data sources and algorithms.
- Provide secure access controls and transaction logging.
- Maintain data caching for one week with immediate access availability.

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- Integration with VII Proof of Concept Probe Data Service.
- Dependency on Road Commission for Oakland County weather data.
- Implementation of computational algorithms for incident detection.
- Compliance with SAE J2735/J2354 data standards.
- Coordination with MDOT’s asset management systems.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Privacy**: Implement anonymization and policy controls for probe data.
- **Data Quality**: Incorporate validation checks for sensor accuracy.
- **Source Availability**: Establish fallback options for third-party data feeds.
- **System Flexibility**: Use modular service architecture to accommodate changes.
- **Policy Compliance**: Adhere to MDOT and USDOT data use agreements.

## Undecided Issues
- Specific interface formats for transit agency data integrations.
- Long-term data ownership policies for commingled sources.
- Metrics for traveler information effectiveness.
- Integration schedules for deferred regional traffic systems.
- Threshold values for automated alert triggers.
