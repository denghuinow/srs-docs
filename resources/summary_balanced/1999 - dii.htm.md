# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
The XML Services (XS) functional area provides infrastructure services for mission and support applications using XML technology within the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment. It delivers capabilities for registering XML terms and structures, designing XML schemas, and generating/consuming XML documents to ensure interoperability across defense systems. The services isolate vendor-unique implementations and provide data management functions for distributed database access.

## Roles and User Stories
- **Data Producer**: I want to submit metadata and information resource artifacts to the XML Registry so that terms can be formally registered and shared
- **Data Consumer**: I want to discover and view XML tags with their relationships so that I can select appropriate structures for application reuse
- **Registry Manager**: I want to review and approve XML submissions so that registry integrity and naming conventions are maintained
- **Application Developer**: I want to design XML schemas using existing registered tags so that interoperability is ensured
- **System Administrator**: I want to manage user accounts and access controls so that registry security is maintained

## Key Processes
1. **Trigger: User submission** → Parse and populate XML Registry database with submitted metadata
2. **Trigger: Design request** → Create XML schemas using registered tags and semantic structures
3. **Trigger: Document generation** → Generate XML documents that include schema references
4. **Trigger: Validation request** → Check XML documents for well-formedness and conformance
5. **Trigger: Consumption request** → Parse and extract semantically-valid views from XML documents
6. **Trigger: Change notification** → Notify subscribers of modifications to Information Resources
7. **Trigger: Maintenance requirement** → Modify metadata terms, definitions, and status codes

## Domain Data Elements
- **XML_Element**: ElementID, ElementName, DataType, Definition, Version
- **XML_Attribute**: AttributeID, AttributeName, ElementID, ConstraintType, ValidValues
- **XML_Spec**: SpecID, SpecType, Content, Version, Status
- **Information_Resource**: ResourceID, ResourceType, Submitter, Status, SubmissionDate
- **Registry_User**: UserID, Role, Permissions, ContactInfo, LastLogin
- **Namespace**: NamespaceID, URI, Owner, Description, RegistrationDate

## Non-functional Requirements
- Portable execution on COE-compliant platforms
- User-definable session time-out values for degraded communications
- Support for heterogeneous data types and sources
- Compliance with DII COE packaging guidelines
- Support for both static (fixed) and dynamic (deployed) operational modes
- Standard API interfaces as specified in appendices

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- Compliance with DII COE baseline requirements
- Integration with COE Management Services APIs
- Interface compatibility with Sybase, Oracle, and Informix database engines
- Adherence to DOD data standards conventions
- Qualification through formal validation tests

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Proliferation of inconsistent XML tags** → Establish registry approval process and naming conventions
- **Semantic misunderstanding of terms** → Implement metadata validation and relationship tracking
- **Communication degradation in deployed environments** → Provide configurable session time-outs
- **Integration with multiple database platforms** → Use standardized APIs and abstraction layers
- **Maintaining registry data integrity** → Implement change control and version management

## Undecided Issues
- Specific qualification test procedures and criteria
- Detailed external programming interface specifications
- Complete internal programming interface definitions
- Final metadata validation rules and constraints
- Specific performance benchmarks and thresholds
- Detailed federation agreements between registries
