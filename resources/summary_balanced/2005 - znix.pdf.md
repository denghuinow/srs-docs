# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
Project ZNIX aims to refine traditional information management systems by providing an object-based, application-independent retrieval and manipulation framework. The system focuses on managing information semantics and making meaningful information accessible to users in logical ways they define. The scope covers the higher-level design of the ZNIX Framework for single-user operation on Windows systems.

## Roles and User Stories
- **As a casual user**, I want to intuitively browse and manage my information so that I can organize data without extensive training
- **As a researcher**, I want to capture and categorize web research materials so that I can maintain project context and relationships
- **As an email user**, I want my email communications automatically linked to contact entities so that I can track correspondence by person
- **As a document creator**, I want to visually create relationships between documents and entities so that I can organize information meaningfully
- **As a developer**, I want to use a public API similar to file system APIs so that I can build ZNIX-aware applications

## Key Processes
1. **System initialization** - Framework services start when the operating system boots
2. **Information capture** - Data is intercepted from supported applications and stored centrally
3. **Entity creation** - User information is stored as either Entities or Associates based on dependency
4. **Relationship management** - Users create and modify hierarchical relationships between entities
5. **Information browsing** - Users navigate the information hierarchy through a Windows Explorer-like interface
6. **Archive management** - Users can archive portions of information to removable media while maintaining references
7. **Query execution** - Users and applications retrieve entities using various criteria through the public API

## Domain Data Elements
- **Entity** (EntityID, Name, Category, CreationDate, Type)
- **Associate** (AssociateID, RelatedEntityID, Content, Type, CreationDate)
- **Relationship** (RelationshipID, SourceEntityID, TargetEntityID, RelationshipType)
- **Category** (CategoryID, CategoryName, ParentCategoryID, Description)
- **Archive** (ArchiveID, EntityID, StorageLocation, ArchiveDate, MediaType)
- **User** (UserID, Preferences, SessionData, AccessRights)

## Non-functional Requirements
- System must run on Intel Pentium III 1-GHz PC with 256MB RAM
- Framework shell memory utilization shall not exceed 40MB
- Mean time between failures shall exceed 3 months
- GUI must be intuitive for Windows 2000/XP users with basic IT skills
- Must guard against malicious scripts and unintended user corruption
- Must support Unicode UTF-8 character encoding standards

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- Compatibility with Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP
- Integration with specified third-party applications (Outlook, Internet Explorer, etc.)
- Open source distribution through community hosting platforms
- Developer documentation and API specification completion
- Compliance with Windows 2000 Logo Requirements

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Third-party application compatibility changes** - Assume compatibility with current versions only
- **Performance on constrained hardware** - Optimize memory usage and implement efficient data structures
- **User adoption of new information paradigm** - Provide intuitive interfaces mimicking familiar Windows applications
- **Security vulnerabilities** - Implement safeguards against script attacks and user errors
- **Community contribution uncertainty** - Establish clear coding conventions and documentation

## Undecided Issues
- Integration method for browser (standalone vs. Windows Explorer integration)
- Complete set of mandatory categories beyond People and Email
- Specific query language implementation details
- Backup and recovery procedures for corrupted data
- Network capability implementation timeline
- Detailed API specification for filesystem-like operations
