# Balanced Summary

**Goals and Scope**  
The HATS Graphical User Interface (HATS-GUI) provides a platform-independent interface to the High Assurance Transformation System (HATS), enabling users to perform program transformations in a provably correct manner. It facilitates application management, parsing and execution of transformation programs, and examination of transformation outputs. The system aims to increase HATS usability and adoption within the transformation and research communities.

**Roles and User Stories**  
- *User*: As a user, I want to parse transformation language programs so that I can generate syntax derivation trees for execution.  
- *User*: As a user, I want to execute transformation programs so that I can apply transformations to target files.  
- *User*: As a user, I want to display and navigate SDT outputs so that I can analyze transformation results.  
- *User*: As a user, I want to configure application settings so that I can customize editor associations and display preferences.  
- *User*: As a user, I want to manage application files so that I can organize transformation projects efficiently.

**Key Processes**  
1. *Trigger: User request* – Select and open an application directory.  
2. *Trigger: User request* – Prepare application by ensuring core domain files exist.  
3. *Trigger: User request* – Parse transformation language or target files using HATS-SML.  
4. *Trigger: User request* – Execute transformation programs to generate output SDTs.  
5. *Trigger: User request* – Display SDT or pretty-printed text outputs for examination.  
6. *Trigger: User interaction* – Navigate and manipulate output displays (expand/collapse nodes, search).  
7. *Trigger: User request* – Save or export application configurations and files.

**Domain Data Elements**  
- *Application* (primary key: name; fields: core files, configuration, file associations)  
- *SDT* (primary key: filename; fields: root node, node labels, tree structure)  
- *Transformation Language Program* (primary key: filename; fields: parsed version, target associations)  
- *Target File* (primary key: filename; fields: parsed version, transformation outputs)  
- *Pretty-Printed Text* (primary key: filename; fields: formatted text, style associations)  
- *Configuration* (primary key: application; fields: editor settings, display colors, expansion levels)

**Non-Functional Requirements**  
- Platform independence (Windows, Solaris, Linux)  
- Performance: Display 10,000-node SDTs within 5 seconds  
- Implemented in Java 1.3 for portability  
- Support concurrent user operations during transformations  
- Search algorithms with O(n²) complexity limits  
- No authentication required for system access

**Milestones and External Dependencies**  
- Completion by December 2001  
- Dependency on HATS-SML version 2.0 availability  
- Java Virtual Machine installation on host systems  
- ML interpreter availability for HATS-SML execution  
- Host OS file system support for hierarchical storage

**Risks and Mitigation Strategies**  
- *Risk*: HATS-SML version delays impacting development timeline  
  *Mitigation*: Coordinate closely with HATS-SML development team  
- *Risk*: Performance issues with large SDT rendering  
  *Mitigation*: Implement efficient tree drawing algorithms avoiding virtual window approach  
- *Risk*: Cross-platform compatibility problems  
  *Mitigation*: Extensive testing on target platforms during development  
- *Risk*: Complex SDT-pretty-printed text mapping  
  *Mitigation*: Implement robust text-node correlation with graceful degradation  
- *Risk*: File system errors during application operations  
  *Mitigation*: Implement comprehensive error handling and user notifications

**Undecided Issues**  
- Specific algorithm for SDT search implementation  
- Default color schemes for node types  
- Handling of extremely large (>1 million node) SDTs  
- Integration with future HATS-SML versions beyond 2.0  
- Support for additional operating systems beyond specified platforms  
- Not mentioned
