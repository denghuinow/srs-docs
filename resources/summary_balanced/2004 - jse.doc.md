# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
This project aims to establish an electronic ISIN issuance system for Money Market Instruments (MMIs) to support dematerialization and same-day trading/settlement. The scope covers automated ISIN creation, amendment, and deletion through SWIFT messaging between STRATE and JSE (as National Numbering Agent), with an estimated daily volume of 200-500 ISINs using the ZAM prefix.

## Roles and User Stories
- **As STRATE**, I want to electronically request new ISINs so that MMIs can be immediately traded and settled
- **As STRATE**, I want to cancel/de-issue ISINs so that instrument lifecycle changes are properly managed
- **As STRATE**, I want to deregister matured ISINs so that instrument records remain current
- **As JSE Operations**, I want to monitor rejections and system activity so that issues can be promptly resolved
- **As JSE Operations**, I want manual override capabilities so that business continuity is maintained during system outages

## Key Processes
1. **Trigger**: STRATE sends ISIN request via MT598-150 NEWM message
2. JSE validates message format and content
3. JSE generates and assigns new ISIN (ZAM prefix)
4. JSE sends confirmation via MT598-151 message back to STRATE
5. **Trigger**: STRATE sends cancellation request via MT598-150 DISS message
6. JSE processes cancellation and confirms via MT598-151
7. **Trigger**: Automated maturity cancellation via MT598-150 MATU message

## Domain Data Elements
- **ISIN Record**: ISIN code, Instrument Category, Issue Date, Maturity Date, Coupon Rate
- **Issuer**: Participant Code, Issuer Name
- **Instrument Type**: MMI Type, Generic Category, Coupon Payment Frequency
- **Transaction**: Transaction Reference, Message Type, Preparation Date/Time
- **Rejection**: Error Code, Related Reference, Error Details
- **Quantity**: Issued Amount, Cancelled Amount

## Non-functional Requirements
- High availability to support same-day trading requirements
- SWIFT ISO15022 standards compliance
- Business Continuity Plan with manual processing capabilities
- Real-time rejection notification via email
- 12-month data retention for reporting
- Parameter-driven reporting and query capabilities

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- NMPG approval of SWIFT message formats
- STRATE cost approval for development and monthly running costs
- JSE BIC branch code "ISN" application and approval
- Service Level Agreement finalization between JSE and STRATE
- Q2 2004 implementation target

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Message format rejection**: Implement comprehensive validation and detailed error reporting
- **System unavailability**: Provide manual ISIN entry screens for BCP scenarios
- **Data inconsistencies**: Maintain reconciliation screens and parameter-driven reporting
- **Volume spikes**: Design for estimated 500 ISINs per day capacity
- **Standards compliance**: Adhere to ANNA Guidelines for ISO 6166 and ISO standards

## Undecided Issues
- Final error code definitions between IOR and NNA
- Monthly running cost billing methodology details
- Complete BCP procedures for extended outages
- Final SWIFT message content approval from NMPG
- Issuer code update procedures and maintenance
