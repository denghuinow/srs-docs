# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: Construction Junction requires a categorized Inventory Management System to track items from donation through sale, integrating with QuickBooks POS and their website for streamlined operations and inventory valuation.

- **In scope**:
  - Categorized inventory viewing and navigation.
  - Management of inventory departments, categories, attributes, and item details.
  - Processing of acquisitions (drop-off, pickup, deconstruction donations).
  - Integration with QuickBooks POS for sales and inventory updates.
  - Reporting on inventory status, changes, and acquisitions.

- **Out of scope**:

  - Custom hardware interfaces beyond specified devices.
  - Legacy inventory data migration.
  - Browser-specific user interface features.
  - Derivative works of open-source or commercial products.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a Receiving Associate, I want to receive and process donated items so that donors get receipts and items are added to inventory.
  - As a Manager, I want to modify item properties and pricing so that inventory data remains accurate and up-to-date.

- **Success metrics**:
  - System availability during all Construction Junction operating hours.
  - Consistent and predictably low response times for all tasks.
