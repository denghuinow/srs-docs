# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The Clarus Initiative, sponsored by FHWA, aims to collect, quality control, and share surface transportation weather and road condition observations to enhance safety, mobility, and weather forecasting across North America.
- **In scope**:
  - Collect atmospheric, pavement, and hydrologic data from fixed and mobile sensors.
  - Implement continuous quality control processes with feedback to data providers.
  - Disseminate quality-controlled environmental data to service providers and stakeholders.
  - Support data queries by location, time, quality, and source.
  - Use NTCIP ESS 1204 standards for data definitions and interfaces.
- **Out of scope**:
  - Direct archiving of large-volume environmental data.
  - Responsibility for data accuracy by FHWA or providers.
  - Critical national security mission support.
  - Defining regional boundaries for data presentation.
  - Development of special database tools beyond standard interfaces.
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a **data collector**, I want to submit environmental observations so that I can share data and receive quality feedback.
  - As a **service provider**, I want to access quality-controlled environmental data so that I can generate value-added weather products.
  - As a **system administrator**, I want to manage user privileges and security groups so that data sharing agreements are enforced.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Respond to 95% of data requests 95% of the time.
  - Publish new data within 20 minutes of receipt.
  - Support 600 concurrent users and 6,000 registered users.
- **Major constraints**:
  - System must use industry-standard, non-proprietary interfaces and protocols.
  - Data must include location, timeframe, and source metadata.
  - Timestamps must use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
  - System must operate on redundant hardware for reliability.
  - Data sharing is conditional on agreements with providers.
- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific regional boundaries for data queries.
  - Long-term data archiving strategy.
  - Integration methods for new sensor technologies.
  - Prioritization criteria for time-critical data handling.
  - Not mentioned: Final selection of data communication standards.
