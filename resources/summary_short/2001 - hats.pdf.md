# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The HATS-GUI is a platform-independent graphical user interface for the High Assurance Transformation System (HATS), developed to simplify user interaction and increase adoption of transformation-based software development. It enables users to prepare applications, execute transformations, and examine outputs.

- **In scope**:
  - Management of applications and associated files.
  - Parsing of transformation language programs and target files.
  - Execution of transformation language programs.
  - Display and manipulation of SDT and pretty-printed transformation outputs.
  - Configuration of application settings and file associations.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Applying transformations directly (handled by HATS-SML).
  - Multi-user support (single user only).
  - Extensive help messages (users are expected to be sophisticated).
  - Direct modification of HATS-SML functionality.
  - Support for operating systems other than Sun Solaris, Windows 2000, and Linux.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a user, I want to execute transformation programs so that I can transform target files and view outputs.
  - As a user, I want to configure application settings so that I can customize editor associations and SDT display properties.
  - As a user, I want to navigate and search SDT outputs so that I can analyze transformation results efficiently.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Display SDTs with 10,000 nodes in ≤5 seconds.
  - Support navigation of large SDTs with minimal performance degradation.
  - Operate without modification on specified platforms (Sun Solaris, Windows 2000, Linux).

- **Major constraints**:
  - Implemented in Java 1.3 for platform independence.
  - Must avoid excessive memory usage in SDT display algorithms.
  - Completed by December 2001.
  - Requires pre-installed JVM and ML interpreter.
  - Designed to minimize the number of open windows.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Not mentioned.
