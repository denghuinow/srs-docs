# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: Establish a statewide e‑mail system to reduce costs and meet executive branch agency needs, as mandated by Florida Statute 282.34, with a proposed plan due by December 31, 2009.
- **In scope**:
  - Basic e‑mail, calendar, and contact services for all users.
  - Archiving, retention, and discovery capabilities to meet legal and regulatory requirements.
  - Security, anti‑virus, and filtering services for message protection.
  - Remote access and mobile messaging support.
  - Backup, restore, and disaster recovery functions.
- **Out of scope**:
  - Collaboration services such as shared documents, instant messaging, and discussion forums.
  - Extended features not classified as basic requirements.
  - Agency‑specific application dependencies not integrated with e‑mail.
  - Non‑e‑mail communication tools (e.g., VoIP integration in basic offering).
  - Custom workflow applications beyond e‑mail‑enabled workflows.
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a user, I want to send, receive, and manage e‑mail and calendars so that I can communicate and organize work effectively.
  - As an agency admin, I want to provision accounts and manage archiving so that agency data is secure and compliant.
  - As a data center admin, I want to enforce security and backup policies so that system integrity and availability are maintained.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Reduction in total e‑mail costs compared to existing agency systems.
  - Ability to meet federal and state confidentiality, privacy, and security requirements.
  - Completion of agency migration to the new system by June 30, 2013.
- **Major constraints**:
  - Plan must be submitted by December 31, 2009.
  - Sourcing options must include in‑house, external, and hybrid models.
  - Must reuse existing e‑mail infrastructure where feasible.
  - Migration must begin by July 1, 2010 and finish by June 30, 2013.
  - All functional requirements are subject to technical and financial feasibility analysis.
- **Undecided issues**:
  - Final sourcing model (in‑house, external, or hybrid).
  - Specific cost‑benefit results for each sourcing option.
  - Exact standardization format for state e‑mail addresses.
  - Full list of existing infrastructure to be reused.
