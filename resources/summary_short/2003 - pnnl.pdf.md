# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: This document specifies requirements for an automated diagnostic tool to detect faults in HVAC subsystems (chillers, cooling towers, boilers) using sensed and fixed data, replacing manual expert analysis with automated algorithms derived from expert practices.
- **In scope**:
  - Real-time and batch-mode input of sensed data from HVAC units and data files.
  - Diagnostic algorithms for chiller and cooling tower subsystems.
  - User interface with hierarchical navigation and diagnostic result display.
  - Storage of diagnostic results and sensed data for historical review.
  - Configurable sensitivity and user privilege levels (general user and administrator).
- **Out of scope**:
  - Diagnostic algorithms for HVAC subsystems beyond chillers, cooling towers, and boilers.
  - Support for non-Windows operating systems.
  - User-defined analysis of diagnostic results.
  - Simultaneous input from real-time devices and data files.
  - Printed reports beyond screen image printing.
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a building operator, I want to monitor current and historical diagnostic results so that I can maintain HVAC system efficiency.
  - As a service technician, I want to start/stop diagnostics and configure parameters so that I can diagnose and repair faults on-site or remotely.
  - As an administrator, I want to modify fixed data and system settings so that I can adapt the tool to specific building configurations and sensitivities.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Detection of specified faults in chiller and cooling tower subsystems with configurable sensitivity.
  - User-friendly interface enabling quick access to current and historical diagnostics.
  - Reliable storage and retrieval of diagnostic results and associated metadata.
- **Major constraints**:
  - Restricted to Microsoft Windows-compatible operating systems.
  - Supports only predefined diagnostic algorithms without user customization.
  - Requires fixed data input and configuration prior to operation.
  - Diagnostic processing halts if input data is missing.
  - Limited to specific sensor types and engineering units (e.g., temperature in °F, current in amps).
- **Undecided issues**:
  - Expansion of diagnostic algorithms to additional HVAC subsystems (Not mentioned).
  - Procedures for deriving setpoints from performance data (Not mentioned).
  - Handling of water-side economizing edge cases (Not mentioned).
  - Support for ambient-temperature-based boiler shutoff diagnostics (Not mentioned).
  - Initialization methods for alarm variables during software start-up (Not mentioned).
