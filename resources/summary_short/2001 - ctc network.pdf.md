# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The C2C Communications Network aims to interconnect Dallas/Ft. Worth regional traffic management systems using ITS standards, providing a common repository for traffic data and enabling device control and status sharing between centers.
- **In scope**:  
  - Roadway network, traffic conditions, incident, and lane closure data interfaces  
  - Device status and control for DMS, LCS, CCTV, ramp meters, HAR, traffic signals, ESS, HOV, parking lots, school zones, railroad crossings, reversible lanes, and dynamic lanes  
  - Web-based graphical traffic map and remote control GUI  
  - Data transmission using TMDD, DATEX/ASN, and TCP/IP  
- **Out of scope**:  
  - Tour video switch command for CCTV (Dallas)  
  - Momentary pan/tilt/zoom/iris/focus commands for CCTV (Ft. Worth)  
  - Firewall and gateway connectivity for remote GUI  
  - Transit data link association management  
  - Non-ITS standard legacy system integration without protocol conversion  
- **Roles and core use cases**:  
  - As a Traffic Management Center operator, I want to monitor and control field devices so that regional traffic flow is optimized.  
  - As a remote user, I want to submit device commands via GUI so that I can manage traffic devices without a formal TMC.  
  - As a web map user, I want to view real-time traffic conditions and incidents so that I can make informed travel decisions.  
- **Success metrics**:  
  - Successful exchange of device control/status between centers  
  - Accurate display of traffic conditions and incidents on the web map  
  - Extensible architecture supporting local, regional, and statewide repository linking  
- **Major constraints**:  
  - Must use TMDD, DATEX/ASN, and TCP/IP for data transmission  
  - Must operate on Microsoft Windows NT environment  
  - Must use ESRI ARC IMS for web mapping  
  - Implementation in C/C++ programming language  
  - Support for both normal and test operational modes  
- **Undecided issues**:  
  - Specific MPH thresholds for web map speed color coding (TBD)
