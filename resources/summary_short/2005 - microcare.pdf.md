- **Background and objectives**: The Voucher Management System (VMUS) is designed to automate the voucher-based STD treatment program for Marie Stopes International Uganda, aiming to improve service quality, reduce fraud, and ensure timely provider payments.
- **In scope**:
  - Voucher creation with unique barcoded identifiers and validity controls.
  - Distributor and sales team management with transaction tracking.
  - Claim entry and processing with validation for treatments, drugs, and patient data.
  - Client feedback collection linked to voucher treatment history.
  - Standard and customized reporting for medical, financial, and operational insights.
- **Out of scope**:
  - Expansion beyond the pilot phase or Mbarara district.
  - Integration with external health record systems.
  - Mobile or web-based voucher distribution.
  - Real-time payment processing to providers.
  - Multilingual or multi-currency support.
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a VMU Admin, I want to create and manage vouchers so that distribution and tracking are secure and efficient.
  - As a Field Office User, I want to process and validate claims so that payments are accurate and fraud is minimized.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Timely reimbursement of clean claims to service providers.
  - Reduction in fraudulent or erroneous claim submissions.

  - Claims must follow MSIU treatment algorithms and matrix for payment.
  - Biometric (thumbprint) validation required for claim verification.
  - User access and permissions controlled via granular group-based security.
- **Undecided issues**:
  - Long-term system scalability beyond the pilot.
