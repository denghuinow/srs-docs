# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The PEPPOL project aims to enable interoperable cross-border eProcurement in the EU by developing a Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) to help economic operators electronically submit required qualification documents to public sector awarding entities across member states.

- **In scope**:
  - Define a staged maturity model for VCD implementation (pre-VCD mapping to VCD network package).
  - Specify functional and non-functional requirements for VCD services and packages.
  - Support mutual recognition of qualification documents across EU member states.
  - Enable electronic collection and submission of attestations and certificates.
  - Ensure compliance with Directive 2004/18/EC Articles 45–50 for selection/exclusion criteria.

- **Out of scope**:
  - Implementation of a common set of attestations or certificates.
  - Mandatory translation of all documents (handled per national requirements).
  - Full automation of all evidence collection processes.
  - Enforcement of changes to national procedures or infrastructures.
  - Guarantee of complete VCD package coverage for all tender-specific criteria.

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As an economic operator, I want to compile and submit a VCD electronically so that I can participate in cross-border public tenders efficiently.
  - As a contracting authority, I want to receive and validate VCD packages so that I can verify supplier qualifications transparently.
  - As a VCD service provider, I want to host VCD systems and services so that I can support secure and reliable document exchange.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Increased number of cross-border tender participations by SMEs.
  - Reduction in administrative burden and costs for economic operators and contracting authorities.
  - Achievement of semantic interoperability for at least Articles 45–46 criteria across pilot countries.

- **Major constraints**:
  - Heterogeneity of national legal frameworks and attestation formats.
  - Dependence on existing national infrastructures and issuing bodies.
  - Need for mutual recognition agreements among member states.
  - Technical and semantic interoperability challenges.
  - Data protection and confidentiality requirements.

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Governance model for European VCD service provider (centralized vs. decentralized).
  - Funding and sustainability model for VCD services post-project.
  - Legal liability of national VCD service providers.
  - Full scope of mutual recognition for candidate statements and context-specific data.
  - Not mentioned: Specific technical standards for all evidence types.
