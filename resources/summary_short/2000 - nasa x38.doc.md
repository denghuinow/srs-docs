# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The X-38 Fault Tolerant System Services (FTSS) provides fault-tolerant software services for NASA's X-38 Crew Return Vehicle Flight Critical Computer, enabling reliable real-time task execution and communication across redundant processors.
- **In scope**:
  - System initialization and synchronization of FCP processors.
  - Scheduling services for 50 Hz, 10 Hz, and 1 Hz rate groups.
  - Fault detection, isolation, and redundancy management.
  - Communication services via message queues and pipes.
  - Memory management including scrubbing and alignment.
- **Out of scope**:
  - Year 2000 compliance (not applicable).
  - Safety and security requirements (none identified).
  - Personnel, training, and logistics-related requirements.
  - Internal data and interface requirements (none specified).
  - Adaptation requirements (none identified).
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As a Flight Critical Processor (FCP), I want to execute synchronized tasks so that the system remains fault-tolerant.
  - As an Instrument Control Processor (ICP), I want to communicate with FCPs so that I/O data is exchanged reliably.
  - As an application developer, I want to use FTSS API calls so that I can manage tasks, communication, and system states.
- **Success metrics**:
  - System initialization completes within 1.5 minutes.
  - Fault detection and isolation within 1 second.
  - Communication latency under 200 microseconds for ICP to FCP transfers.
- **Major constraints**:
  - Must use VxWorks 5.4 and C programming language.
  - FTSS and VxWorks together must use ≤3 MB ROM and ≤9 MB DRAM.
  - All FCP object modules must be identical.
  - Compiled and tested under Tornado 2 for NT environment.
- **Undecided issues**:
  - Not mentioned.
