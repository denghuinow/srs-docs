# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: KeePass Password Safe is an open-source password manager designed to securely store user passwords, usernames, URLs, and notes in an encrypted database protected by a single Master Password, eliminating the need to memorize multiple passwords.
- **In scope**:
  - Create, open, save, and search encrypted password databases.
  - Organize entries into groups and subgroups.
  - Generate and manage passwords, including one-time TANs.
  - Auto-type sequences for automated login input.
  - Import/export data in formats like CSV and XML.
- **Out of scope**:
  - Password recovery or backdoor access if Master Password is lost.
  - Support for non-specified password database formats.
  - Modifying TAN entry title, username, or URL fields.
  - Changing the global hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+K).
  - Multiple database files via command line.
- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As an end user, I want to store and retrieve passwords securely so that I don't have to remember them.
  - As an advanced user, I want to use auto-type and command-line options so that I can automate logins and workflows.
  - As a system administrator, I want to manage multiple user accounts securely so that organizational data remains protected.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Database remains inaccessible without the correct Master Password or key file.
  - Copied passwords are cleared from memory after 10 seconds.
  - Supports defined operating systems and interfaces without feature loss.
- **Major constraints**:
  - Runs only on specified Windows versions and WINE.
