- MVP points: Collect probe vehicle, traffic, and weather data; derive traffic and incident information from probe data; publish data in SAE J2354 format; provide web-based user interfaces for browsing traffic and weather information.
- Key constraints: Must conform to Michigan Department of Information Technology standards; must use Michigan Geographic Framework geo-references; must protect data privacy and ownership.
- Major risks/undecided issues: Data latency and quality may affect usability; data ownership and redistribution limitations from third-party sources may hamper usefulness.
