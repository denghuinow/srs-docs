# Ultra Short Summary

Pontis 5.0 is a next-generation bridge management system designed to replace Pontis 4.x with modern technology while preserving agency investments and providing enhanced data management, condition assessment, and analysis capabilities.

- **MVP points**: The system shall enable bridge inventory and inspection data entry and editing; perform program simulation and bridge analysis; support project and program development; and allow data exchange in formats including NBI, PDI, and XML.
- **Key constraints**: Development must use Microsoft .NET technologies and support Sybase, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server databases; the system must maintain consistency with existing Pontis 4.x functionality; and the BRIDGEWare database design must be consistent with Pontis 4.4, with changes approved by the BRIDGEWare Database TAG.
- **Major risks**: Requirement creep may expand scope beyond initial estimates; and the .NET standard could become obsolete during the development cycle.
