# Ultra Short Summary
A digital radio system for European railways ensuring interoperability and supporting ground-train voice/data communications and ground-based mobile communications.

- **MVP Points**
  - Support voice services including point-to-point, emergency, broadcast, group, and multi-party calls.
  - Provide data services for text messaging, general data, fax, and train control applications.
  - Implement railway-specific services such as functional addressing, location-dependent addressing, and shunting mode.
  - Ensure call set-up times under 2 seconds for Railway emergency calls and under 10 seconds for low-priority calls.

- **Key Constraints**
  - The system must support mobile speeds up to 500 km/h and operate in allocated 900 MHz railway frequency bands.
  - Mandatory features are required for interoperability; optional features must follow specified standards if implemented.
  - Environmental and physical requirements must comply with European Norms and ISO 9001 quality procedures.

- **Major Risks/Undecided Issues**
  - Automatic joining of group calls for Cab Radios entering an area requires further technical specification changes.
