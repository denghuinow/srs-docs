# Ultra Short Summary
- The BEYOND project develops adaptive, multimodal user interfaces for public terminals, home systems, vetronics, and avionics to enhance usability and safety.
- MVP points:
  - Public terminals support multimodal interaction and context-aware dialogs.
  - Home UI editor enables flexible UI design and simulation for consumer devices.
  - Vetronics UI editor allows off-line adaptive interface creation for rugged vehicle displays.
  - Avionics flight deck assists pilots with integrated warnings and adaptive displays.
- Key constraints:
  - Public terminals require high ergonomic standards and speaker-independent voice recognition.
  - Consumer systems must operate under limited RAM, no hard disk, and slow processors.
  - Vetronics displays must withstand extreme environmental conditions like vibrations and temperature.
- Major risks/undecided issues:
  - Longitudinal usability studies for adaptivity are needed but not fully conducted.
  - Not mentioned.
