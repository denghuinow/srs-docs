# Ultra Short Summary
The NLM Digital Repository is an OAIS-compliant system designed to acquire, preserve, and provide long-term access to NLM's digital biomedical collections.

- **MVP Points**: Ingest digital materials in various formats; generate and manage descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata; provide secure, multi-level user access; ensure long-term preservation through format migration and error checking.
- **Key Constraints**: Must integrate with existing NLM systems like the Integrated Library System; must comply with HHS/NIH security standards; depends on evaluation of software options and availability of staff resources.
- **Major Risks**: Policy development for migration strategies and ingest requirements is incomplete; budget and staffing for implementation are not yet determined.
