# Ultra Short Summary
A nationwide system to collect, quality control, and disseminate surface transportation weather and road condition observations from multiple networks.

**MVP Points**
- Collect atmospheric, pavement, and hydrologic data from approved sources including fixed/mobile sensors and vehicles.
- Implement continuous automated quality control processes and flag data quality.
- Disseminate quality-controlled environmental data to service providers and other users.
- Support queries for environmental data by location, timestamp, and quality.

**Key Constraints**
- System must use open, non-proprietary standards and interfaces.
- Data must include location, timeframe, and source metadata.
- System must operate on redundant hardware with 24x7 availability.

**Major Risks/Undecided Issues**
- System usefulness depends on participation from multiple data providers and consumers.
- Not mentioned.
