# Ultra Short Summary
A platform-independent graphical user interface for the High Assurance Transformation System (HATS) to simplify user interaction with transformation-based software development tools.

- **MVP points**:  
  - Manage applications by creating, deleting, and modifying files and associations.  
  - Parse transformation language programs and target files into syntax derivation trees.  
  - Execute transformation language programs to apply transformations to target files.  
  - Display and navigate SDT and pretty-printed text outputs with search and selection features.

- **Key constraints**:  
  - Must be implemented in Java and run on Windows 2000, Sun Solaris, and Linux without code modification.  
  - Must complete development by December 2001.  
  - Must minimize the number of windows opened by the application.

- **Major risks/undecided issues**:  
  - HATS-SML version 2.0 availability by October 2001 is assumed but not confirmed.  
  - Not mentioned.
