# Ultra Short Summary
GOG is a modular software simulator for generating Gaia mission catalog, main database, and final data without using actual telemetry or databases.

**MVP points**
- Generate data from Universe Model or user-provided object catalog.
- Compute epoch parameters including astrometry, photometry, and radial velocity with errors.
- Compute combined parameters by merging all transit data for parallax, proper motions, and mean values.
- Simulate RP/BP and RVS spectra with configurable noise models.

**Key constraints**
- Output formats must comply with Universe Model and Main Database Interface Control Documents.
- Must process one complete source within 2 CPU seconds.
- Must run on Linux, UNIX, and Mac platforms.

**Major risks/undecided issues**
- Not mentioned
