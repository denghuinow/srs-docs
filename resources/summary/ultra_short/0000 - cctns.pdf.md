Purpose & Scope: The system addresses gaps in crime investigation and criminal detection for Indian police forces. It enables complaint registration, case investigation, court prosecution, and search capabilities for police personnel. Excludes citizen case tracking, forensic analysis, and external law enforcement agency integration.

Product Background / Positioning: Part of India's e-Governance Mission Mode Project, it replaces fragmented state-level police systems. Integrates with existing police infrastructure at state level, supporting centralized deployment with state-specific configuration.

Core Functional Overview:  
- Complaint registration and digital evidence intake  
- Case investigation workflow automation  
- Court prosecution record management  
- Advanced case/person/property search  
- Role-based citizen complaint interface  
- Configurable state-specific data elements  

Key Users & Usage Scenarios: Police investigation officers (full access), records staff (limited access), and citizens (complaint submission only). Officers use case search during investigations; citizens submit complaints via mobile/web; records staff manage configuration data.

Major External Interfaces: State-level deployment with browser-based access (all major browsers). Supports mobile access via PDAs/terminals. Integrates with state-specific police systems for data exchange.

Key Non-functional Requirements:  
- Search response: ≤15 seconds (simple: ≤8s, advanced: ≤15s)  
- Case retrieval: ≤20 seconds for infrequently accessed cases  
- System availability: 24/7 operation with ≤2 hours unplanned downtime/quarter  
- Audit trail: Unalterable, retained for case lifecycle  

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies: Centralized deployment required. Must function offline for critical complaint registration. State-specific configuration mandatory. Relies on existing state police network infrastructure.

Priorities & Acceptance Approach: Highest priority on investigation/criminal tracking capabilities. Acceptance based on verified performance metrics (search/response times), audit trail compliance, and offline functionality for complaint registration.
