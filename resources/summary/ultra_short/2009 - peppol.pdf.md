Purpose & Scope: The Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) enables economic operators to electronically submit evidence of qualification for public tenders across European borders. It provides a structured container for attestations, certificates, and self-declarations that prove compliance with selection and exclusion criteria under Directive 2004/18/EC. The VCD does not implement a common set of attestations but establishes a framework for mapping national attestations to European criteria. It supports a staged maturity model from basic interoperability (Stage 1) to advanced electronic evidence exchange (Stage 4).

Product Background / Positioning: Developed under the PEPPOL project to address fragmentation in European public procurement systems. The VCD supports EU goals for 100% electronic procurement by 2010 and builds on initiatives like BRITE. It integrates with existing national systems and PEPPOL infrastructure to enable cross-border evidence exchange without requiring fundamental changes to national procurement practices.

Core Functional Overview: Pre-VCD mapping tool (Stage 1) enables mapping of national attestations to European criteria. VCD simple package (Stage 2) creates structured electronic dossiers containing evidence. VCD advanced package (Stage 3) adds context-specific data and recompilation capability. VCD network package (Stage 4) enables "on-demand" retrieval of attestations. The system supports mutual recognition of evidence across borders through standardized data structures.

Key Users & Usage Scenarios: Economic operators use VCD to collect and submit evidence for cross-border tenders. Contracting authorities use VCD to evaluate evidence against tender criteria. National VCD service providers host systems and manage evidence. Typical scenarios include cross-border tender participation, evidence collection from national issuing bodies, and validation of qualifications for pan-European procurement.

Major External Interfaces: Pre-VCD mapping tool (European service), PEPPOL infrastructure (for transportation), national issuing systems (for evidence retrieval), and tendering platforms (for submission). Interfaces focus on semantic interoperability rather than specific technical protocols.

Key Non-functional Requirements: Must support basic interoperability (Stage 1) and semantic interoperability (Stages 2-4). Must ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. Must provide reliable access to evidence with multiple language support. Must be compatible with existing national systems and procurement practices.

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies: Requires national implementation of pre-VCD mapping (Stage 1) as mandatory foundation. Depends on national legal frameworks for mutual recognition of evidence. Requires national VCD service providers to host systems. Assumes contracting authorities specify criteria in formal format. Depends on availability of electronic attestations from issuing bodies.

Priorities & Acceptance Approach: Stage 1 (pre-VCD mapping) is mandatory for all Member States. Stage 2 (VCD simple package) is the basic implementation. Stages 3-4 are optional enhancements. Acceptance based on conformance to pre-VCD mapping and successful testing through historical tender reprocessing. National implementations must follow common interoperability guidelines monitored by the European VCD Service Provider.
