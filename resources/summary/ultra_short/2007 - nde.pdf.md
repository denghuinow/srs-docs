Purpose & Scope: The NDE system processes and delivers environmental satellite data products from NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) and NPOESS satellites to NOAA operational and climate communities, as well as civilian customers. It receives data from the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS), generates tailored products, and archives NOAA-unique products to CLASS. The system does not handle satellite launch operations or raw sensor calibration.

Product Background / Positioning: NDE operates within NOAA's Environmental Satellite Processing Center (ESPC) as a critical component of the NPOESS data exploitation ecosystem. It interfaces with IDPS for data ingestion, CLASS for long-term archiving, and the NPOESS Mission Management Center (MMC) for operational coordination, replacing legacy data distribution processes.

Core Functional Overview: 
- Generate and deliver data products in multiple formats (BUFR, GRIB2, GeoTIFF, HDF5, netCDF) with configurable projections (Platte Carre, Mercator, Polar Stereographic).
- Manage user subscriptions, product availability, and delivery notifications for registered customers.
- Monitor input data integrity and system health with real-time latency tracking.
- Implement automatic failover between operational and test environments during failures.
- Archive NOAA-unique products to CLASS with metadata compliance.
- Support data product recovery within configurable shelf-life (max 96 hours).

Key Users & Usage Scenarios: 
- Registered customers (NOAA operational units, climate researchers, civilian users) access subscribed products via Open Mode or restricted Data Denial Mode.
- Developers use the development environment to build and test system elements (algorithms, tools) without impacting operations.
- ESPC operators monitor system health, manage failover, and handle trouble tickets for production issues.

Major External Interfaces: 
- IDPS for data ingestion (xDRs, SARSAT telemetry, A-DCS data).
- CLASS for product archiving and retrieval.
- NPOESS Mission Management Center (MMC) for operational coordination.
- Trouble ticket systems (NPOESS and ESPC) for incident management.

Key Non-functional Requirements: 
- Availability: ≤2 hours interruption per 24 hours, ≤4 hours per 30 days for ingest, product generation, and distribution; 85% availability for development environment (8am-4pm ET, Mon-Fri).
- Performance: IDPS data access ≤10 seconds, SARSAT telemetry delivery ≤1 minute, product latency ≤5 minutes.
- Capacity: 4 TB/day input/8 TB/day output (NPP era); 8 TB/day input/16 TB/day output (NPOESS-C1/C2 eras).
- Security: Compliance with NOAA IT Security Manual 212-1300; data integrity protection against hardware, software, and natural disasters.

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies: 
- Must reuse existing hardware/software where feasible and approved by NOAA.
- Must use COTS/Open Source software where feasible and approved by NOAA.
- Must comply with OMB Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) standards.

Priorities & Acceptance Approach: 
- Top priority: System availability, data integrity, and meeting performance metrics.
- Acceptance: System must achieve all specified availability, performance, capacity, and security requirements during acceptance testing.
