Purpose & Scope: The system enables public health agencies to investigate, monitor, and contain health events (including bioterrorism) by collecting and analyzing data on cases, contacts, exposures, and related entities. It focuses on data capture for containment efforts and excludes direct treatment administration or countermeasure logistics.  

Product Background / Positioning: Integrates with existing public health systems for early event detection, laboratory response, and surveillance to support coordinated outbreak management across jurisdictions.  

Core Functional Overview:  
- Case investigation with dynamic data capture  
- Entity linking (persons, locations, animals, objects)  
- Contact exposure tracing and monitoring  
- Analysis and visualization of outbreak data  
- Report generation for public health response  

Key Users & Usage Scenarios: Public health investigators and response teams. Investigators collect case/contact data during field investigations; teams generate reports for containment decisions. No role-based permission differences specified.  

Major External Interfaces: Must exchange data with laboratory systems (test requests/results), surveillance systems (case classifications), and public health partner systems via standardized messages.  

Key Non-functional Requirements:  
- Unique identifiers for events, cases, and specimens within jurisdiction  
- Systems must remain operational post-catastrophe  
- Data integrity and security against unauthorized access/corruption  

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies:  
- Must support disconnected operation with data synchronization  
- Requires use of established vocabulary standards for data exchange  
- Relies on jurisdiction-level identifier uniqueness  

Priorities & Acceptance Approach:  
- Highest priority: Lab result exchange and case classification sharing (key performance measure)  
- Acceptance requires successful data exchange with laboratory/surveillance systems and unique identifier implementation
