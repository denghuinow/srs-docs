Purpose & Scope  
ZNIX provides an object-based framework for centralized user information management, enabling hierarchical organization and retrieval of personal data. It operates as a single-user system on Windows, with no networking capabilities. The system does not support multi-user access, third-party application integration beyond specified tools, or archival to media other than CD-ROM/USB drives.

Product Background / Positioning  
ZNIX positions itself as a lightweight alternative to resource-heavy systems like Windows Longhorn (targeting 256MB RAM vs. 2GB+), and as a more API-driven solution than Project Haystack (which lacks proxy mechanisms for non-ZNIX-aware apps). It integrates with core Windows applications to manage email, contacts, web research, and documents.

Core Functional Overview  
- Centralized storage for user information (email, contacts, web, documents).  
- Hierarchical information organization based on user-defined relationships.  
- Archiving to removable media with persistent metadata for restored access.  
- Public API for client applications to manage entities and relationships.  
- Proxy mechanism enabling non-ZNIX-aware applications (e.g., Outlook, Word) to interact with the framework.

Key Users & Usage Scenarios  
Primary users are home users, managers, and researchers with basic IT skills. The system requires no specialized training; users interact via Explorer-like GUI to organize information. Permissions are uniform—no role-based access control is specified.

Major External Interfaces  
Interfaces with Windows applications (Outlook 2003, Word 2003, Internet Explorer, Firefox) for email, contact, and document management. No hardware, communication, or external service interfaces required.

Key Non-functional Requirements  
- MTBF must exceed 3 months.  
- RAM usage capped at 40 MB.  
- Must run on Intel Pentium III or compatible 1-GHz PC with 256 MB RAM.  
- Supports Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP only.

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies  
Mandatory hardware: Pentium III 1-GHz, 256 MB RAM. Single-user operation only. Assumes compatibility with listed third-party apps (e.g., Outlook 6.0, Word 2003) across their standard releases. Relies on security of target applications for framework protection.

Priorities & Acceptance Approach  
Highest priority: Resource efficiency (RAM, hardware constraints) and core functionality (centralized storage, hierarchy, archiving). Acceptance requires meeting all "MUST" constraints (hardware, MTBF, RAM) and functional capabilities (API, proxy, archiving). Open-source licensing (LGPL/GPL) is mandatory.
