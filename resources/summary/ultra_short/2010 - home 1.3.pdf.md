Purpose & Scope  
DigitalHome is a prototype system for managing home environmental controls (temperature, humidity, security, appliances) via web interface. It operates in a simulated environment with no physical hardware; all sensors/controllers are software emulations. Excludes commercial deployment, real-home testing, and non-environmental features like entertainment systems.  

Product Background / Positioning  
Developed by HomeOwner Inc.’s DigitalHomeOwner Division as a business-decision prototype based on High Level Requirements Definition. Not a commercial product; intended solely to evaluate market viability for future development.  

Core Functional Overview  
- Temperature control via programmable thermostats (8 max, 24 schedules/day).  
- Humidity control via programmable humidistats (8 max, 24 schedules/day).  
- Security management for 50+ door/window sensors and alarm activation.  
- Appliance control for 100+ power switches (ON/OFF states).  
- Monthly planning and reporting of environmental data, security events, and system uptime.  

Key Users & Usage Scenarios  
General users monitor/control via web interface (e.g., adjust thermostat remotely). Master/Technician users configure system settings, manage accounts, and set up hardware (e.g., add sensors). Technicians have full admin rights; general users have limited access.  

Major External Interfaces  
Web server (user access point), home gateway device (wireless communication hub), and simulated sensors/controllers. Interfaces limited to web-based commands and wireless data transmission.  

Key Non-functional Requirements  
- Sensors update at ≥10 Hz; environmental displays refresh every 2 seconds.  
- System reliability: ≤1 failure per 10,000 hours.  
- Daily automated backups of all system data.  
- TLS encryption for authentication and data security.  

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies  
Prototype must be delivered within 12 months by a 5-person team. Development uses simulated environment only; no physical home or real sensors. Requires broadband internet via ISP.  

Priorities & Acceptance Approach  
Top priority: Validate business case via prototype functionality. Acceptance based on meeting all functional requirements and simulated environment constraints for management decision-making.
