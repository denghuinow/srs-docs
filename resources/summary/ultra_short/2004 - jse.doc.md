**Purpose & Scope**  
The system electronically issues, cancels, and deregisters ISINs for money market instruments (MMIs) to enable same-day trading and settlement. It exclusively handles MMIs (using ZAM prefix), excluding equities (ZAE) and bonds (ZAG). Physical ISIN processes and primary market issuance for non-MMIs are out of scope.  

**Product Background / Positioning**  
JSE acts as the National Numbering Agent (NNA) under ANNA/ISO rules. STRATE (post-merger of UNEXcor/STRATE) serves as the Central Securities Depository Participant (CSDP) and sole interface for MMF participants. The system integrates with STRATE’s SAFIRES settlement platform via SWIFT MT598 messages, replacing manual processes.  

**Core Functional Overview**  
- ISIN request processing for new MMIs (ZAM prefix).  
- ISIN cancellation/de-issuance for active instruments.  
- Automated cancellation on maturity date.  
- Real-time rejection handling for invalid requests.  
- ISIN confirmation and rejection notifications.  
- Front-end views for issued/cancelled/de-registered ISINs.  

**Key Users & Usage Scenarios**  
- STRATE (CSDP): Initiates all ISIN requests, cancellations, and maturity events.  
- Issuers (banks): Submit MMI details via STRATE; receive confirmations.  
- JSE Operations: Monitor rejections, view ISIN status, and manage front-end data.  
*Scenario:* STRATE sends MT598-150 for new MMI → JSE issues ISIN → STRATE receives MT598-151 confirmation.  

**Major External Interfaces**  
SWIFT MT598 message interface between STRATE (initiator) and JSE (NNA). No UI or protocol details specified; only message types (e.g., NEWM, DISS, MATU) and rejection codes (901/902) are referenced.  

**Key Non-functional Requirements**  
- Process 200–500 ISIN requests daily with SLA-backed availability (24/7).  
- Adhere strictly to ANNA/ISO 6166 rules for ISIN generation.  
- Maintain Business Continuity Plan (BCP) per Service Level Agreement (SLA).  

**Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies**  
- ISO 6166 and ANNA guidelines are mandatory for ISIN issuance.  
- STRATE is the sole external interface; no direct MMF participant access.  
- ZAM prefix required for all MMIs (distinct from ZAE/ZAG).  
- NMPG approval for SWIFT message content is a prerequisite.  

**Priorities & Acceptance Approach**  
STRATE funds development; acceptance requires SLA compliance, NMPG-approved SWIFT messages, and 200–500 ISIN/day processing. Priorities: ISIN issuance (critical), cancellation (high), maturity handling (medium). Acceptance is validated via SLA metrics and message flow testing.
