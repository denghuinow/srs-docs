**Purpose & Scope**: The Tactical Control System (TCS) provides command and control for Predator and Outrider UAVs across five interaction levels, from basic data receipt to full UAV control from takeoff to landing. It does not include UAV hardware, only the control system software and interfaces. The system is not designed for full HAE UAV operations beyond payload data receipt.

**Product Background / Positioning**: Developed jointly by Navy and Army for tactical UAV control, the TCS integrates with existing C4I systems including ASAS, AFATDS, JSTARS, and service-specific mission planners. It serves as a common interface across military services to replace multiple proprietary control systems.

**Core Functional Overview**: 
- Mission Planning: Create and manage UAV mission plans with flight routes, payload, and communications
- Mission Control & Monitoring: Real-time control of UAVs, payloads, and data links
- Payload Product Management: Process, display, and exploit EO/IR/SAR imagery
- Targeting: Develop target coordinates and estimate accuracy
- C4I System Interface: Interact with C4I systems for tasking, data sharing, and dissemination

**Key Users & Usage Scenarios**: Military operators control UAVs and plan missions; maintainers perform system maintenance and diagnostics. The system supports three operational modes: normal operations, training, and maintenance. Training mode operates without affecting real mission execution.

**Major External Interfaces**: Interfaces with C4I systems (ASAS, AFATDS, JSTARS, etc.), data terminals for UAV communications (LOS and SATCOM), printers, external storage, and standard military power sources. All interfaces follow DII/COE standards.

**Key Non-functional Requirements**: Startup within 60 seconds (normal) or 45 seconds (recovery); MTBF and MTTR matching Predator/Outrider ORDs; availability (Ao) matching Predator/Outrider ORDs; 50% spare memory capacity; throughput not exceeding 50% of capability; COMSEC compliance for classified data.

**Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies**: Must comply with DII/COE, JTA, and CIGSS standards; must support all five UAV interaction levels; must interface with specified C4I systems as per implementation schedule; must use standard DoD components where possible.

**Priorities & Acceptance Approach**: Highest priority is supporting all five UAV interaction levels, with Level 5 (full UAV control) being critical. Acceptance requires meeting all specified requirements, passing integration tests, and demonstrating compliance with Predator/Outrider ORDs for reliability, maintainability, and availability.
