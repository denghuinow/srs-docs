Purpose & Scope: The system automates fault detection and diagnostics for chiller and cooling tower subsystems in HVAC systems, replacing manual visual analysis by human experts. It detects and identifies specific operational faults, provides visual fault indicators with descriptions, causes, and recommended fixes, and stores results for historical review. The tool does not support boiler diagnostics in its initial version, nor does it provide user-defined analysis of diagnostic results beyond the predefined fault categories.

Product Background / Positioning: Developed for Architectural Energy Corporation by Battelle under sponsorship from the California Energy Commission and U.S. Department of Energy. It replaces a current manual diagnostic process where data acquisition devices feed into graphical display software for human review. The tool preserves the logical construction of the current process (preprocessing, diagnostic, output components) but automates the diagnostic phase.

Core Functional Overview: Detect and identify faults in chiller and cooling tower subsystems based on sensed and fixed data. Provide visual fault indicators (OK, Caution, Not OK) with fault descriptions, causes, and recommended fixes. Store diagnostic results with absolute time, unit identity, and diagnostic identity. Support real-time and batch data input from acquisition devices or files. Allow configuration of diagnostic parameters and sensitivity adjustment. Enable user authentication with role-based permissions (general user vs. administrator). Support indefinite duration diagnostic processing.

Key Users & Usage Scenarios: General users (building operators) view current/historical diagnostics periodically (seconds to minutes). Administrators (service technicians, energy providers) configure diagnostics, adjust sensitivity, and modify fixed data. Service technicians use daily (up to hours), energy providers use continuously for remote monitoring. Building operator supervisors use to guide work assignment decisions. All users require HVAC system knowledge but varying computer expertise.

Major External Interfaces: Interfaces with data acquisition devices for real-time sensed data and data files for batch processing. Interfaces with Windows-compatible platforms (no other OS support). User interface consists of six windows with specific hierarchical navigation (main, configuration, subsystems, condition, diagnostic information, diagnostic history).

Key Non-functional Requirements: Must validate sensed data against defined ranges (e.g., temperature -40F to 130F). Must store sensed data with three significant figures precision. Must support only Windows-compatible operating systems. Must handle missing data with defined indicators (e.g., null values). Must authenticate users with three attempt limit before dismissal.

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies: Initial version focuses exclusively on chillers and cooling towers (boiler diagnostics are separate). Must support configuration management of fixed data (set points, specifications, configuration). Must operate without printed reports (only screen printing available). Must support indefinite duration diagnostic processing. Must not process diagnostics when input data is missing.

Priorities & Acceptance Approach: Highest priority is accurate fault detection for specified subsystems and fault categories (Table 7). Secondary priority is clear user interface with role-based access. Acceptance requires detection of all faults listed in Table 7 with associated descriptions, causes, and fixes. Diagnostic results must be stored with absolute time, unit identity, and diagnostic identity.
