**Purpose & Scope**: The NLM Digital Repository preserves and provides access to biomedical digital content, including digitized and born-digital materials. It handles ingest, storage, preservation, and access functions while excluding projects outside Library Operations responsibility (e.g., UMLS, Visible Human) and web harvesting functionality.

**Product Background / Positioning**: Built on the OAIS reference model, the repository integrates with existing systems like PubMed Central and Bookshelf. It replaces microfilming as a preservation method and addresses unique challenges of digital preservation versus analog materials.

**Core Functional Overview**: Ingest processes submissions with quality assurance and AIP generation; Archival Storage manages media, error checking, and disaster recovery; Data Management handles metadata queries and reporting; Administration negotiates agreements and establishes policies; Preservation Planning monitors technology and develops strategies; Access coordinates user requests with role-based permissions.

**Key Users & Usage Scenarios**: General public with access restricted by licensing/embargo; NIH staff with access based on location/embargo; NLM staff with metadata editing access; NLM staff with object maintenance access; NLM system administrators with full system control.

**Major External Interfaces**: Integrates with Integrated Library System for bibliographic data; interfaces with NIH Consolidated Collocation Site (NCCS) for backup; uses metadata standards including Dublin Core, METS, and PREMIS; supports OAI-PMH for metadata harvesting.

**Key Non-functional Requirements**: Must comply with HHS/NIH security standards; must provide statistically acceptable error checking via CRCs; must support disaster recovery with off-site data storage; must maintain data integrity through fixity checks; must support multiple languages and non-Roman scripts.

**Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies**: Must prioritize intellectual content preservation over original "look and feel"; must maintain original collections after digitization; will not provide special software for accessing materials; must support multiple ingest streams; must not be a dark archive (objects must be available for use).

**Priorities & Acceptance Approach**: Highest priority is preserving intellectual content. Acceptance requires compliance with OAIS model, NLM collection policies, and permanence rating system (Permanent vs. Permanence Not Guaranteed). Must follow NLM's existing selection criteria for digitization.
