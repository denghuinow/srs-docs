Purpose & Scope  
This plan ensures sufficient, strategically located Black Start generators can initiate grid restoration after complete system blackouts. It covers generators capable of self-starting without external power to energize transmission and auxiliary loads. It excludes generators that only safely reject load down to auxiliary levels.

Product Background / Positioning  
CAISO maintains this plan as its Balancing Authority for grid restoration, coordinating with WECC and NERC. It aligns with broader WECC restoration requirements and relies on generator contracts (RMR, Interim, Voluntary) for operational capability.

Core Functional Overview  
- Annual verification of Black Start generator quantity, location, and availability against WECC requirements.  
- Documentation of cranking paths and switching requirements between Black Start units and other generators.  
- Mandatory testing every five years for Voluntary units, with annual testing for RMR/Interim units.  
- Enforced start time limits: hydro/gas turbines ≤30 min, industrial gas ≤60 min, steam ≤150 min.  
- Validation of generator availability through four-hour tests meeting ≥99% of requested MW.

Key Users & Usage Scenarios  
CAISO Operations verifies generator readiness and dispatches tests. Generator owners conduct tests and report results. WECC/NERC review documentation upon request. Key scenario: CAISO dispatches a Black Start test during system restoration planning.

Major External Interfaces  
WECC for coordination of restoration plans. NERC for compliance with reliability standards. Generator owners for test execution and data submission. Interfaces are defined by contractual and regulatory requirements.

Key Non-functional Requirements  
Start-up completion within 30–150 minutes per unit type. Generator availability validated via four-hour tests achieving ≥99% of requested MW. Annual testing cycle for RMR/Interim units. Safety-compliant testing procedures mandatory.

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies  
Hydro units cannot be tested during constrained water availability. CAISO determines test timing without prior notification. Success depends on generator cooperation and WECC restoration plan alignment. Testing requires 24-hour advance notification to CAISO.

Priorities & Acceptance Approach  
Highest priority: Annual testing and availability validation for RMR/Interim units. Acceptance requires ≥99% MW achievement in four-hour test. Failure necessitates corrective plans submitted to CAISO within 30 days.
