Purpose & Scope:  
Provides real-time text messaging via TV for Platform-i users, demonstrating MHP capabilities. Excludes file transfers, webcam support, and new Passport account creation. Operates independently within the TV environment without external system integration.

Product Background / Positioning:  
Independent MHP application for Platform-i, distinct from PC-based MSN Messenger. Designed to showcase Platform-i's multimedia potential within the TV ecosystem, with no dependencies on other projects.

Core Functional Overview:  
- Presence management (status updates, buddy visibility)  
- Real-time text messaging (with emoticons and session history)  
- Buddy list operations (add, delete, block)  
- Buddy status and nickname display  
- TV program sharing (viewing buddies' current channel)  
- Hotmail inbox integration (notifications and message display)  

Key Users & Usage Scenarios:  
Single user type: end-users interacting via TV remote. Permissions limited to standard IM functions. Typical scenarios: chatting with buddies, checking their TV programs, and viewing Hotmail notifications on-screen.

Major External Interfaces:  
Uses .NET Messenger Protocol (MSNPv8) for messaging. Interfaces with TV screen (output) and remote control (input).

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies:  
Requires MSNPv8 protocol availability; system design must change if protocol becomes unavailable.
