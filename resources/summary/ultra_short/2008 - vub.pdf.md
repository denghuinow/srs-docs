Purpose & Scope: The system manages academic publications for VUB users, enabling search, download, and publication management. It excludes external network access for unregistered users, audio/video support, and non-VUB network access for non-logged-in users.  

Product Background / Positioning: A university-specific tool for VUB faculty/students, built on Wilma server (Linux/Ruby), replacing manual publication handling. Integrates with existing VUB network authentication and database systems.  

Core Functional Overview:  
- Search publications by keyword, author, or date  
- Download publications (single/multiple)  
- Upload publications (PDF/PS) with auto-bibliography extraction  
- Edit personal account details  
- View publication references (BIB/RIS export)  
- Manage user accounts (create/delete)  

Key Users & Usage Scenarios:  
- Guest: Register, validate account  
- VUB-Network User: Search/download publications (IP-based access)  
- Member: Search/download, edit profile  
- Publisher: Upload/edit own publications  
- Moderator: Edit departmental publications, manage user levels  
- Admin: Full system control, user/group management  

Major External Interfaces:  
- Web interface (XHTML 1.0 Transitional) for all users  
- Command Line Interface (CLI) for Admins only (VUB-network access)  
- MySQL database backend  

Key Non-functional Requirements:  
- Must run exclusively on Linux (Wilma server)  
- Passwords encrypted at rest and in transit  
- Database consistency maintained (no orphaned records)  
- System availability during Wilma uptime; error messaging during downtime  

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies:  
- Mandatory Linux environment (Wilma server)  
- Ruby 1.8+ implementation  
- No external libraries/frameworks permitted  
- VUB network required for non-logged-in access  

Priorities & Acceptance Approach:  
- Critical (Phase 1): Core search, download, upload, and user management  
- Acceptance: All critical functions must operate per SRS specifications; database consistency verified via backup/recovery.
