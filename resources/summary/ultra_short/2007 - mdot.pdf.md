Purpose & Scope:  
The DUAP system is a prototype research tool for MDOT to evaluate Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) data utility in enhancing safety, mobility, and asset management. It processes probe vehicle, traffic, weather, and road condition data from multiple sources. The system does not support operational traffic management or public-facing services beyond research demonstrations.  

Product Background / Positioning:  
DUAP integrates with existing MDOT systems (e.g., MITS Center, RWIS) and VII network infrastructure to transform raw data into actionable insights for transportation agencies. It serves as a research vehicle to assess data integration feasibility before potential operational deployment.  

Core Functional Overview:  
- Collect probe vehicle data (SAE J2735 format) from VII networks and OEM fleets.  
- Cache dynamic data (raw/derived) for immediate processing (1-week retention).  
- Derive traffic/road conditions via computational services (e.g., incident detection, travel time).  
- Archive persistent data (raw/derived) for long-term analysis.  
- Publish output in SAE J2354 format for external systems.  
- Provide web-based presentation services for traffic/weather data visualization.  

Key Users & Usage Scenarios:  
Transportation agency operators (traffic management), maintenance staff (road condition monitoring), emergency responders, and researchers. Operators use real-time incident data for response actions; maintenance staff access road condition analytics for prioritized repairs.  

Major External Interfaces:  
VII network (probe data), MDOT traffic management systems (MITS Center), weather data sources (RWIS, Clarus), and external systems via SAE J2354 interfaces. No UI/protocol details included.  

Key Non-functional Requirements:  
Data processing within near real-time (latency ≤ 5 minutes). Data quality checking mandatory. Compliance with MDIT software standards. System must cache data for 1 week.  

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies:  
Anonymized probe data must comply with privacy policies; third-party data ownership limits may restrict integration. System is a prototype (not operational). Success depends on VII network data availability and OEM participation.  

Priorities & Acceptance Approach:  
High-priority requirements (H) are essential for core research objectives; medium (M) and low (L) are non-essential. Acceptance requires validation against H-priority requirements in ConOps and traceable test cases.
