Purpose & Scope  
The system replaces all state agency email systems with a centralized statewide service by June 2013, mandated by Florida Statute 282.34. It covers email, calendaring, and contacts; excludes collaboration tools (e.g., shared documents, workflows) and non-email messaging like instant messaging.  

Product Background / Positioning  
This is a state-wide enterprise service replacing fragmented agency email systems to reduce costs and ensure compliance. It integrates with existing agency directories and must align with federal/state security and retention laws.  

Core Functional Overview  
- User email, calendar, and contact management (send/receive, rules, sharing).  
- Archiving with retention policies (Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA compliance).  
- Security: virus filtering, encryption (TLS), and spam control.  
- Mobile/web access for all users across devices.  
- Admin provisioning and migration of agency email systems.  

Key Users & Usage Scenarios  
End-users: Send/receive email, manage calendars, access via mobile. Agency admins: Migrate systems, manage public folders, enforce retention policies. Data center admins: Configure security, backup, and disaster recovery.  

Major External Interfaces  
LDAP directory integration for user provisioning. Mobile protocols (BlackBerry, iOS, Android) for remote access. External systems for email archiving and legal discovery.  

Key Non-functional Requirements  
Must meet Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and Florida Public Records Law. Plan submission deadline: December 31, 2009. Migration to new system must start July 1, 2010, complete June 30, 2013.  

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies  
Excludes collaboration features (e.g., shared documents). Solution must satisfy all basic requirements (no "would like to have" features). Success depends on agency inventory data availability.  

Priorities & Acceptance Approach  
Basic requirements are mandatory; extended features are optional. Acceptance requires a plan meeting legal deadlines and core functionality, with feasibility analysis for all requirements.
