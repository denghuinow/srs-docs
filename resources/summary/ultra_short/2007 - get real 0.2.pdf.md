Purpose & Scope  
The system attracts Oregon high school students (grades 9–12) to pursue computer science degrees at Oregon University System campuses. It provides career information, campus resources, and student-focused content to encourage CS enrollment. Excludes non-educational content, direct admissions processing, and support for students outside Oregon.  

Product Background / Positioning  
An update to the existing Get Real website (Version 1), hosted as a subdomain of OUS (getreal.ous.edu). Runs on OSU servers within the OUS domain to maximize search visibility. No integration with external systems beyond standard web interfaces.  

Core Functional Overview  
1. Real People profiles featuring video stories from CS professionals in diverse careers.  
2. Jobs & Money section answering career value and salary questions.  
3. Women in Computer Science profiles highlighting community involvement.  
4. High School Courses recommendations for CS-prep curricula.  
5. Internal site search functionality for Get Real content.  
6. Professional Organizations directory (ACM, IEEE, student groups).  

Key Users & Usage Scenarios  
Primary users: Oregon high school students (grades 9–12). Two distinct groups: (1) Students already interested in CS seeking concise career details; (2) College-bound students needing motivation to consider CS. Non-CS-interested users require simplified, visually engaging content to avoid "walls of text."  

Major External Interfaces  
Browser compatibility for IE, Firefox, and Netscape. No hardware, software, or communication interface requirements beyond standard web protocols.  

Key Non-functional Requirements  
Response time must match OUS site performance standards. Site must track user engagement metrics (hits, time spent) for iterative design improvements. Web design must align with OUS style conventions.  

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies  
Limited Chancellor’s Office resources for development. Bandwidth constraints for video streaming. No external dependencies for site functionality.  

Priorities & Acceptance Approach  
Highest priority: Teen-friendly design to retain student attention and drive CS enrollment. Acceptance based on measurable engagement metrics (e.g., time-on-site, repeat visits) and adherence to OUS design standards.
