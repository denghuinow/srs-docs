**Purpose & Scope**  
The system enables semantic interoperability for Smart Grid data across utility organizations. It focuses on data modeling and sharing standards, excluding operational control systems and non-Smart Grid business processes.  

**Product Background / Positioning**  
It positions as the foundational framework for enterprise data integration within the OpenSG initiative, aligning with TOGAF 9.0 and leveraging IEC Common Information Model (CIM) standards to unify data across utilities.  

**Core Functional Overview**  
- Share standardized data models with external entities (B2B/B2C).  
- Manage Smart Grid and non-Smart Grid data through common classification.  
- Incorporate IEC CIM into enterprise semantic models.  
- Support joint data management for Smart Grid and non-Smart Grid contexts.  
- Enable persistent data stores with collocated Smart Grid/non-Smart Grid data.  

**Key Users & Usage Scenarios**  
Business units within utility organizations use the system to define and share data models. Permissions are role-based per business unit, with scenarios centered on model collaboration and data integration.  

**Major External Interfaces**  
Interfaces with external entities for model sharing (B2B/B2C). Boundaries defined by data model standards (IEC CIM) and integration protocols.  

**Key Non-functional Requirements**  
Requires semantic interoperability via IEC CIM standard compliance. Data management must support collocated Smart Grid and non-Smart Grid data in persistent stores.  

**Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies**  
Depends on IEC CIM standard adoption. Assumes existing utility data structures can be mapped to the EIM semantic model. No constraints explicitly stated beyond standard dependencies.  

**Priorities & Acceptance Approach**  
Highest priority: Semantic interoperability via IEC CIM. Acceptance requires successful model sharing across external entities and compliant data store implementation.
