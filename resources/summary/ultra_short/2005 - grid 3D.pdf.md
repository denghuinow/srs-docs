**Purpose & Scope**  
The system visualizes biological data in 3D to enable users to analyze attribute differences at a glance, addressing gaps in existing tools. It handles data visualization only; no data generation, processing, or storage is included. The product boundary excludes external data formatting and analysis beyond the 3D view.  

**Product Background / Positioning**  
Developed for the NIMR parasitology department, the application targets research scientists needing a specialized visualization tool. It integrates with existing workflows via tab-delimited data files and relies on partner tools like Matlab for pre-processing, but operates independently.  

**Core Functional Overview**  
- Plot biological data points in scientifically accurate 3D grids with labeled axes.  
- Color points by cluster value from input data.  
- Handle up to 2,000 data points per visualization.  
- Support single/double-click point selection for name/details display.  
- Enable user-controlled grid rotation, zoom, and movement.  
- Return graphical views and point-specific details to users.  

**Key Users & Usage Scenarios**  
Primary users are research scientists (including students and data-mining specialists) within NIMR’s parasitology department. Roles include: "Identifiers" (initial point selection), "Investigators" (detailed analysis), and "Demonstrators" (presenting views). All use the same core interface without role-based permission differences.  

**Major External Interfaces**  
Data input via tab-delimited files meeting specified column headers. Runs on Windows/Linux server-side environments. Interfaces with partner systems (Matlab, Tomcat) only for data preparation or deployment, not real-time integration.  

**Key Non-functional Requirements**  
- Startup time ≤30 seconds (depending on data size).  
- User interaction delay ≤2 seconds for point selection.  
- Grid orientation changes must not interrupt user workflow.  
- Screen output must print clearly (black-on-white).  
- Requires no specialist training for basic operation.  

**Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies**  
- Must run on Windows/Linux; server-side execution mandatory.  
- Requires minimum mid-range PC with mouse/keyboard input.  
- Deadline: Deliverable ready by March 2005 for scientific paper inclusion.  
- Assumes users can create tab-delimited files and operate basic OS functions.  

**Priorities & Acceptance Approach**  
Top priority: Meeting the March 2005 deadline for paper inclusion. Acceptance requires verified performance metrics (startup time, interaction delay) and full support for the 2,000-point limit. Core visualization functionality is non-negotiable; all other features are secondary.
