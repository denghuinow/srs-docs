Purpose & Scope
The Fault Tolerant System Services (FTSS) provides critical software services for NASA's X-38 Crew Return Vehicle flight computer. It enables quad-redundant operation of the Flight Critical Computer (FCC) system, managing scheduling, communication, fault tolerance, and time services. The system does not include hardware design or specific application code.

Product Background / Positioning
FTSS is the core software layer for NASA's X-38 Flight Critical Computer (FCC), built on Draper's Fault Tolerant Parallel Processor (FTPP) architecture. It operates on four Flight Critical Processors (FCPs) as a quad-redundant virtual group, interfaces with five Instrument Control Processors (ICPs), and manages communication through five Network Elements (NEs). The system is integrated within the X-38 avionics architecture.

Core Functional Overview
- Scheduling Services: Manages task execution across vehicle modes with 50Hz, 10Hz, and 1Hz rate groups; completes mode changes within 1.02 seconds
- Communication Services: Provides synchronous message queues and immediate pipes for inter-processor communication
- Fault Detection and Isolation: Performs Initial BIT (IBIT) during startup and Continuous BIT (CBIT) during operation
- Redundancy Management: Handles processor and network element failures through recovery, reintegration, and masking
- Memory Management: Implements memory scrubbing at 10MB/8 minutes and memory alignment during recovery
- Time Services: Provides Mission Elapsed Time (MET) and Separation Elapsed Time (SEP) with 50 PPM accuracy

Key Users & Usage Scenarios
Primary users are NASA flight operations personnel and system maintainers. Key usage scenarios include system initialization after power-on, fault recovery during flight, and normal operation across various vehicle modes. The system operates without user interaction during normal operation.

Major External Interfaces
Interfaces include an Application Programming Interface (API), Network Elements (NEs), Radstone hardware, VxWorks operating system, Flight Critical Processor-Instrument Control Processor (FCP-ICP) communication, and Multi-Protocol Communications Controller (MPCC). The system provides transparent communication between virtual groups.

Key Non-functional Requirements
Must tolerate two non-simultaneous hardware faults throughout the mission. Scheduling must complete mode changes within 1.02 seconds. Must maintain synchronization across processors with ≤330 microseconds skew. Memory scrubbing must process 10MB every 8 minutes. MET and SEP must have 50 PPM accuracy and maintain congruence across all FCPs.

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies
Must execute on Radstone Power PC 604R hardware with VxWorks 5.4. Must fit within 3MB ROM and 9MB DRAM. Must support operation with any 3 of 5 active Fault Containment Regions (FCRs). Must be compatible with the existing X-38 avionics architecture and flight software.

Priorities & Acceptance Approach
Critical requirements include fault tolerance, synchronization, and recovery time. Acceptance criteria require successful demonstration of fault tolerance, timing constraints, and recovery within 1.5 minutes. Verification will be achieved through testing, analysis, and inspection methods as specified in qualification provisions.
