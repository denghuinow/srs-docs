Purpose & Scope: Processes ASPERA-3 instrument telemetry from Mars Express into standardized IDFS data sets for scientific analysis and archival. Handles all science data processing, storage, and distribution. Does not perform instrument calibration or spacecraft operations; excludes engineering data validation beyond basic error handling.

Product Background: Ground data system developed by SwRI for IRF and ESA's Mars Express mission. Integrates with ESOC for telemetry ingestion, provides data to ASPERA-3 Co-Investigators, and submits PDS-compliant data to NASA's Planetary Data System for long-term archiving.

Core Functional Overview: Acquire telemetry from ESOC; process science data into IDFS; store telemetry and IDFS locally; deliver IDFS to Co-Investigators within 24 hours; provide public web displays of current data; submit PDS-compliant data within 6 months of acquisition.

Key Users & Usage Scenarios: ASPERA-3 Co-Investigators (full data access, password-protected); general public (current data via web displays). Co-Investigators require timely data for science analysis; public access supports education and mission transparency.

Major External Interfaces: ESOC (telemetry input); NASA PDS (IDFS output); web server (public displays); Co-Investigator distribution channels (data delivery).

Key Non-functional Requirements: IDFS data delivery to Co-Investigators within 24 hours of telemetry acquisition (error-free); PDS submission within 6 months of data acquisition; password protection for Co-Investigator data access.

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies: Must produce PDS-compliant data; requires ESOC telemetry availability; no safety/security requirements beyond password protection; dependent on ESA's Mars Express launch schedule.

Priorities & Acceptance Approach: Critical: 24-hour Co-Investigator data delivery and 6-month PDS submission deadlines. Acceptance: Verified via demonstration of data delivery timelines and PDS compliance checks.
