Purpose & Scope  
GOG generates statistically equivalent pre-processed catalog, main database, and final mission data for the Gaia mission without relying on GASS telemetry, GIBIS, or the ESAC database. It simulates astrometric, photometric, radial velocity, and spectral data for scientific analysis. The system does not produce raw instrumental data or model crowding effects between sources.

Product Background / Positioning  
GOG integrates into the Gaia Simulator project using GaiaSimu and Gaia Tools libraries. It serves as a modular, configurable tool for DPAC/CU2 teams to generate synthetic data for mission planning and calibration, replacing reliance on other simulation systems.

Core Functional Overview  
- Generate source data from Universe Model (sky region-based) or user-provided object catalog.  
- Simulate epoch data (astrometry, photometry, radial velocity) with user-selectable instrumental/reduction noise.  
- Compute combined data (parallax, proper motion, mean photometry) from multiple epochs.  
- Simulate spectra for RP/BP and RVS instruments with noise modeling.  
- Output data compliant with Universe Model ICD and Main Database specifications.  
- Process sources at 2 CPU seconds per source for 20% of the final catalog size.

Key Users & Usage Scenarios  
Scientific users within DPAC/CU2 coordinate units generate synthetic data for mission analysis. Users configure source generation, noise models, and output parameters via input files. Outputs support mission planning, calibration validation, and data processing algorithm testing.

Major External Interfaces  
Input: XML configuration files defining source generation, noise models, and output parameters.  
Output: Universe Model-compliant catalog files and Main Database format data for DPC distribution.  
Interfaces depend on GAIA-C3-SP-ESAC-JH-002 (Main Database ICD) and GAIA-C2-SP-LAOB-CR-001 (Universe Model ICD).

Key Non-functional Requirements  
- Process 20% of final catalog size (≈1 billion sources) within 2 CPU seconds per source.  
- Support Linux, Unix, and Mac platforms with platform-independent results.  
- Guarantee identical output for identical input configurations.  
- Ensure output format compliance with referenced ICDs.

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies  
Relies on available error models from calibration teams; final MDB specifications may require updates. Initial versions use current MDB specifications due to incomplete final data model. Output format alignment depends on pending ICDs.

Priorities & Acceptance Approach  
Critical: Accuracy of simulated data against error models (verifiable via test cases).  
Secondary: Performance (2 CPU seconds/source) and format compliance (ICD validation).  
Acceptance requires validation against ICDs and reproducible outputs for specified inputs.
