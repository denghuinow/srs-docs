**Purpose & Scope**:  
HATS-GUI provides a platform-independent graphical interface for the High Assurance Transformation System (HATS), simplifying user interaction with transformation-based software development. It manages applications, parses transformation language programs and target files, executes transformations, and displays SDT and pretty-printed outputs. It does not implement transformation logic (handled by HATS-SML) or manage HATS-SML installation.

**Product Background / Positioning**:  
HATS-GUI is a Java-based GUI delivered with HATS to increase adoption by the transformation and research community. It addresses limitations of the prototype, which lacked portability and adequate output display, enabling broader user experimentation and feedback for HATS development.

**Core Functional Overview**:  
- Application management (create, open, save, delete)  
- Parsing of transformation language programs and target files  
- Execution of transformation language programs  
- Display and manipulation of SDT outputs  
- Display and manipulation of pretty-printed text outputs  
- Configuration of SDT display settings (colors, shapes, expansion levels)  
- Search functionality for SDTs and text  

**Key Users & Usage Scenarios**:  
Sophisticated users with expertise in transformation-based software development. They prepare applications, execute transformations, examine outputs, and configure display settings. No extensive help messages are required due to user expertise.

**Major External Interfaces**:  
- HATS-SML (version 2.0) for transformation services  
- Host OS (Windows 2000, Solaris, Linux) for file services and process execution  
- Menu-driven user interface with specific menu structure  

**Key Non-functional Requirements**:  
- Performance: Display 10,000-node SDTs in ≤5 seconds; display 1,000,000-node SDTs in same time plus/minus 2 seconds  
- Platform independence: Run on Windows 2000, Solaris, and Linux without code modifications  
- Concurrent operations: Allow user to continue working while transformations execute  
- Memory efficiency: Avoid unacceptable SDT display algorithms  

**Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies**:  
- JVM and ML interpreter must be installed  
- HATS-SML version 2.0 must be available by October 2001  
- HATS runs on same system as HATS-GUI  
- Single-user at a time  
- Hierarchical file system required  

**Priorities & Acceptance Approach**:  
Platform independence and performance metrics are critical success factors. Acceptance requires meeting SDT display performance targets across all supported platforms, with concurrent operation capability as a hard constraint.
