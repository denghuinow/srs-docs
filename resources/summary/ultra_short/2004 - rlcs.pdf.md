Purpose & Scope:  
The system replaces aging reversible lane control software for I-15 peak-hour traffic management. It opens/closes reversible lanes for morning/evening commutes and special events. Excludes traffic flow algorithms, public traveler information, and physical infrastructure changes.  

Product Background / Positioning:  
Replaces legacy RLCS application within Caltrans District 11’s traffic operations. Integrates with ATMS-2, ValuePricing/FasTrak, and ATIS via external server data store. Does not interface directly with field hardware beyond driver software.  

Core Functional Overview:  
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for status monitoring, device control, and configuration  
- Process Monitoring & Control for real-time device status and command validation  
- Sequencing for automated lane opening/closing operations  
- Data Processing & Security for encrypted database operations and integrity checks  
- Reporting for system logs, operational summaries, and safety compliance  

Key Users & Usage Scenarios:  
- Operator: Single-user command control during normal operations (e.g., lane configuration)  
- Management: Read-only access to reports and system status  
- Field Maintenance: Limited control during maintenance mode (e.g., manual device overrides)  
- System Administrator: Full configuration, security setup, and rule management  
*External systems (ATMS, FasTrak) retrieve status data but are not users.*  

Major External Interfaces:  
- External server data store: One-way status updates (open/closed, customer eligibility) for ATMS/ValuePricing  
- Secure remote dial-in: Two-way access for authorized administrators via firewall  

Key Non-functional Requirements:  
- Availability: 24/7, 365 days/year (99.99% uptime; ≤50 minutes downtime/year)  
- Performance: Device status updates ≤2 seconds; command execution ≤12 seconds  
- Security: MD5 hashing (128-bit) for data integrity; encrypted passwords; non-volatile memory storage  
- Reliability: Continuous operation ≥30 days without reboot; degraded-mode failover  

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies:  
- Must use fiber/ISDN for primary/secondary communications (no wireless)  
- No parallel operation with legacy system during deployment; full field testing required before decommissioning  
- External server data store updated once per minute for external systems  

Priorities & Acceptance Approach:  
All performance and availability requirements are "Must Have." Acceptance requires:  
1. 24/7 uptime with ≤50 minutes annual downtime  
2. Status updates ≤2 seconds  
3. Successful degraded-mode failover testing (e.g., TMC failure → FCU control)  
4. Validated integrity checks via MD5 hash verification (daily)
