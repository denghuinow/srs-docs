**Purpose & Scope**  
The system enables XML-based data interoperability across Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) applications by providing registry, schema design, document generation, and consumption services. It eliminates vendor-specific data access dependencies and supports distributed database access. Excludes direct database management or application-specific content creation.

**Product Background / Positioning**  
Serves as a foundational COE component for mission applications, integrating with existing DII systems (e.g., GCCS, STACCS) via standardized XML services. Aligns with DII COE compliance requirements and replaces legacy data access methods.

**Core Functional Overview**  
- Register XML terms, tags, and schemas via metadata submission and approval workflows.  
- Design XML schemas using existing tags and semantic structures.  
- Generate XML documents with schema validation and versioning.  
- Consume XML documents via parsers and semantic view extraction.  
- Manage registry metadata, user permissions, and naming conventions.

**Key Users & Usage Scenarios**  
Data consumers (view/reuse tags), database managers (submit/modify schemas), and network resource managers (configure registry access). Scenarios include registry browsing for tag reuse, schema design for new applications, and XML document generation for interoperable data exchange.

**Major External Interfaces**  
Standard APIs for registry services (Appendix B) and data access services (Appendix C). Interfaces to COE-compliant platforms and commercial RDBMS (Sybase, Oracle, Informix) via transparent internal integration.

**Key Non-functional Requirements**  
Registry must be portable across COE-compliant platforms. Session timeout values must be user-definable and resettable before user session initialization. System must support COE compliance levels specified in I&RTS.

**Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies**  
Requires COE-compliant platform execution. Depends on existing DII COE infrastructure (e.g., DAC, DBIF). No new commercial product interfaces defined beyond listed RDBMS vendors.

**Priorities & Acceptance Approach**  
Essential (E) priority for registry compliance, session timeout control, and COE platform portability. Acceptance requires validation of all essential requirements via testing and demonstration per SRS qualification methods.
