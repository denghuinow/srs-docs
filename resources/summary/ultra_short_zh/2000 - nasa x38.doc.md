**Purpose & Scope**  
The FTSS provides fault tolerance for the X-38 Crew Return Vehicle's Flight Critical Computer (FCC), which uses a quad-redundant Fault Tolerant Parallel Processor (FTPP) architecture. It handles system initialization, fault detection, redundancy management, and task scheduling for the FCC's four Flight Critical Processors (FCPs) and five Instrument Control Processors (ICPs), but does not handle application logic.

**Product Background/Positioning**  
FTSS is a core component of the FCC's software stack, providing essential fault tolerance services to application code. It interfaces with VxWorks OS and hardware components (Network Elements, Radstone processors) to enable the FCC to maintain operation through multiple hardware faults.

**Core Functionality Overview**  
1. Scheduling Services: Manages task execution at 50 Hz, 10 Hz, and 1 Hz rate groups (≤1 ms overhead per frame), supporting up to 5 vehicle modes, 3 rate groups per mode, and 20 tasks per rate group.  
2. Fault Detection & Isolation: Detects faults during initialization (IBIT) and continuously (CBIT), with ≤2 ms processing time under nominal conditions.  
3. Redundancy Management: Handles processor and network element failures, degrading system configuration as needed, with recovery within 1.5 minutes.  
4. Memory Management: Includes memory scrubbing (10 MB/8 min) and memory alignment (≤1 sec/MB) for fault recovery.  
5. Time Services: Provides congruent Mission Elapsed Time (MET) and Separation Elapsed Time (SEP) with 50 PPM accuracy across all FCPs.  
6. Communication Services: Provides synchronous message queues and immediate pipes for inter-Virtual Group communication.

**Key Users & Usage Scenarios**  
Primary users are application software on FCPs (for scheduling, fault handling) and ICPs (for communication with FCPs). All users require congruent operation across redundant system components. ICPs use limited FTSS services for communication with FCPs.

**Main External Interfaces**  
- API: For application code to access FTSS services  
- Network Elements (NEs): For fault-tolerant communication between virtual groups  
- Radstone: For hardware-specific interface and bit testing  
- VxWorks: As the underlying operating system  
- FCP-ICP: For synchronization and data exchange between flight and instrument processors

**Key Non-Functional Requirements**  
- Fault tolerance: Two-fault tolerance for non-simultaneous hardware faults  
- Timing: 50 Hz rate group processing ≤1 ms; fault recovery within 1.5 minutes  
- Memory: ≤3 MB ROM, ≤9 MB DRAM, with 4 MB DRAM for realignment  
- Synchronization: Power-on skew ≤2.5 seconds; FCP synchronization within 1.5 minutes

**Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies**  
- Must run on Radstone Power PC 604R with VxWorks 5.4  
- Must support 5 FCRs (Fault Containment Regions) with 3+ active  
- Must handle power-on skew up to 2.5 seconds  
- Must support 3+ FCRs active without degradation

**Priority & Acceptance**  
Critical: Fault tolerance, recovery times, and timing constraints. Acceptance requires successful demonstration of fault detection, recovery within 1.5 minutes, and meeting all timing and memory constraints as verified through qualification testing.
