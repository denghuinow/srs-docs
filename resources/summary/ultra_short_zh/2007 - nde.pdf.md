Purpose & Scope  
System processes NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) and NPOESS satellite data to generate customer-ready environmental products. Excludes direct satellite operations; focuses on data exploitation, product generation, and distribution.  

Product Background & Positioning  
Serves as NOAA’s primary interface between NPOESS data (via IDPS) and end-users. Integrates with CLASS archive for long-term storage and interfaces with NPOESS Mission Management Center (MMC).  

Core Functionality (Top 8)  
- Ingest xDRs, SARSAT telemetry, and A-DCS data from IDPS.  
- Generate NOAA-unique products in BUFR, GRIB2, GeoTIFF, HDF5, and netCDF formats.  
- Support product compression (GZIP, ZIP, RICE, JPEG) and projections (Platte Carre, Mercator, Polar Stereographic).  
- Distribute products to CLASS archive and authorized users.  
- Operate in Open, Degraded, and Restricted Access modes with automated mode transitions.  
- Maintain 99% reliability for scheduled/event-driven tasks.  
- Implement automated data integrity checks for input streams.  
- Enable 96-hour shelf life for NOAA-unique products.  

Key Users & Scenarios  
- **Operational Users**: Receive products via CLASS or direct delivery; require 5-minute latency.  
- **Developers**: Access test environments for algorithm development; need 95% system element reliability.  
- **NPOESS Operators**: Monitor degraded operations via automated notifications.  

Critical External Interfaces  
- IDPS (data ingestion, subscriptions, delivery notifications).  
- CLASS (archive ingest, receipt acknowledgments).  
- NPOESS MMC (real-time status/inquiries).  
- Trouble ticket systems (NPOESS/ESPC).  

Key Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Availability**: ≤2 hours interruption/day, ≤4 hours/month for ingest/generation/distribution.  
- **Performance**: IDPS data access ≤10 seconds; SARSAT telemetry delivery ≤1 minute.  
- **Throughput**: 4 TB/day input/output (NPP era); 8 TB/day (NPOESS-C1/C2 eras).  
- **Security**: Full compliance with ESPC security procedures; data integrity protection against all failure modes (human, transmission, software, hardware, natural disasters).  

Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies  
- **Hard Constraint**: Must reuse existing hardware/software where feasible.  
- **Critical Dependency**: NPOESS Ground System operational status dictates Degraded Mode activation.  
- **Assumption**: All data integrity checks defined by authorized users.  

Priority & Acceptance  
- **Highest Priority**: Product availability (≤5-minute latency), data integrity, and 99% task reliability.  
- **Acceptance**: Measured via system logs, CLASS receipts, and user satisfaction surveys; no subjective "good" or "fast" terms used.
