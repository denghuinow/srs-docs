# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The Grid 3D Application is designed to visualize biological data in a three-dimensional environment, allowing users to investigate data attributes at a glance. The product addresses the need for an unavailable tool that can display scientific data in 3D with intuitive interaction capabilities. Non-goals include advanced data analysis features beyond visualization and support for non-scientific data types.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
**Roles:** Identifier, Investigator, Demonstrator, Research Scientist, Data-mining Scientist, Research Student

**Main Scenarios:**
- Identifier supplies data and receives 3D graphical view
- Investigator requests point details and receives textual information
- Demonstrator uses application for presentation purposes
- User rotates/moves/zooms grid for different viewing angles
- User selects single/multiple points for information display

## Business Process
**Main Process (Data Visualization):**
1. User supplies formatted biological data file
2. Application parses data and validates format
3. System generates initial 3D grid visualization
4. User interacts with grid (rotate/move/zoom)
5. User selects data points
6. System displays point information
7. User continues investigation or ends session

**Key Branches:**
- **Data Format Error:** System rejects invalid file, prompts user for correction
- **Point Selection:** Single click shows name, double-click shows full details

## Domain Model
**Entities:**
- DataPoint (name: required, x_value: required, y_value: required, z_value: required, cluster: required, description: required)
- Grid (axis_labels: required, orientation: required)
- UserSession (user_type: required, data_file: required)
- Visualization (points: required, colors: required, labels: required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **File System** (Input): Tab-delimited text files with specific column format
- **Operating Systems** (Platform): Windows 98/2000/NT/XP, Linux, Solaris compatibility
- **Matlab** (Partner): Data format conversion and pre-processing
- **Tomcat/Apache/Ant** (Deployment): Application deployment infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** valid biological data file, **when** user loads data, **then** system displays 3D grid with correctly positioned and colored points
- **Given** displayed grid, **when** user clicks data point, **then** system shows point name within 2 seconds
- **Given** oriented grid, **when** user requests point details, **then** system displays complete point information

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance:** Application starts within 30 seconds, point interaction delay ≤2 seconds
- **Reliability:** Supports up to 2000 data points without performance degradation
- **Compatibility:** Runs on Windows and Linux platforms with mouse/keyboard input

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Requirements specification approval
2. Core visualization engine development
3. User interface implementation
4. Cross-platform testing
5. User acceptance testing
6. Production deployment for March 2005 paper submission

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Tight timeline:** Prioritize core features, defer enhancements
- **Cross-platform compatibility:** Early testing on target platforms
- **Data format complexity:** Provide clear formatting specifications and validation
- **Performance with large datasets:** Optimize rendering algorithms for 2000-point limit

## Undecided Issues and Responsible Parties
- Specific color mapping algorithms for cluster visualization (Development Team)
- Detailed error handling for malformed data files (Development Team)
- Browser compatibility matrix for Java deployment (Not mentioned)
- Backup and recovery procedures (Not mentioned)
