# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The X-38 Fault Tolerant System Services (FTSS) provides critical software services for NASA's X-38 Crew Return Vehicle Flight Critical Computer (FCC). The system operates as a quad-redundant Flight Critical Processor (FCP) virtual group with five simplex Instrument Control Processors (ICPs). FTSS delivers fault-tolerant scheduling, communication, memory management, and redundancy management services layered on PowerPC hardware and VxWorks OS. Non-goals include handling non-Radstone hardware components and providing application-specific control logic.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
**Primary Roles:** FCP Application Task (cyclic execution), ICP I/O Task (sensor/actuator interface), System Manager (mode changes), Fault Handler (recovery operations). **Main Scenarios:** System initialization with 2.5s power-on skew tolerance, 50Hz rate group execution with 330μs jitter, fault detection/isolation within 1 second, processor reintegration within 1.5 minutes. **Exception Scenarios:** Babbling NE detection within 20ms, processor watchdog timeout recovery, memory alignment during channel recovery.

## Business Process
**Main Process (Normal Operation):** 1) 50Hz timer interrupt triggers scheduler 2) Execute rate group tasks by priority 3) Synchronous message exchange at frame boundaries 4) Continuous BIT execution 5) Health status monitoring 6) Telemetry transmission at 10Hz 7) Command reception processing 8) Watchdog timer reset. **Key Branch A (Fault Recovery):** Trigger: Fault detection → Isolate faulty component → Mask failed channel → Initiate voted reset → Attempt resynchronization → Perform memory alignment → Reintegrate processor. **Key Branch B (Startup):** Trigger: Power-on reset → Execute IBIT tests → Synchronize FCP virtual group → Initialize ICP simplex groups → Launch application tasks → Enable 50Hz interrupt.

## Domain Model
**VirtualGroup** (VID: required/unique, redundancyLevel: required, memberProcessors: reference), **Task** (taskID: required/unique, rateGroup: reference, priority: required), **RateGroup** (rate: required, vehicleMode: reference, taskList: reference), **MessageQueue** (queueID: required/unique, maxMessages: required, maxMessageSize: required), **FaultLog** (faultID: required/unique, timestamp: required, component: required), **MemoryRegion** (regionID: required/unique, type: required [congruent/non-congruent], size: required), **TimeService** (MET: required, SEP: required, resolution: required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **Network Element**: Direction: Bidirectional, Theme: Byzantine-resilient packet exchange, Input: Descriptor blocks with error syndromes, Output: Class 0/1/2 data packets, SLA: 150μs broadcast latency
- **Application API**: Direction: FTSS to Application, Theme: Service access points, Input: Task creation parameters, Output: Status/error codes, SLA: 1ms scheduler overhead
- **VxWorks OS**: Direction: FTSS to OS, Theme: Restricted system calls, Input: Task control requests, Output: System resources, SLA: Deterministic execution
- **MPCC/CTC**: Direction: Bidirectional, Theme: Telemetry/command transfer, Input: 12.8KB telemetry blocks, Output: Command data, SLA: 5.2ms processing time

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** 3+ synchronized FCPs at power-on **When** system initialization completes **Then** quad-redundant virtual group forms within 1.5 minutes
- **Given** operational FCP virtual group **When** processor fault detected **Then** faulty channel masked within 3 minor frames and recovery initiated
- **Given** rate group task installation **When** 50Hz interrupt occurs **Then** tasks execute in priority order with ≤330μs jitter
- **Given** message queue creation **When** synchronous send operation called **Then** message delivered at next frame boundary with guaranteed ordering

## Non-functional Metrics
**Performance:** Scheduler overhead ≤1ms per minor frame, Memory alignment rate ≥1MB/second. **Reliability:** Two-fault tolerance for non-simultaneous hardware faults, 30,000+ hours operational service life. **Security:** Byzantine resilience against arbitrary component faults. **Compliance:** MIL-STD-498 documentation standards, Year 2000 time compliance. **Observability:** 5000 bps telemetry budget for fault reporting, health status monitoring at 50Hz.

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1) IBIT validation on all Radstone boards 2) Quad-redundant synchronization testing 3) Fault injection and recovery verification 4) Memory alignment performance validation 5) Telemetry/command interface certification 6) CD-ROM delivery of qualified FTSS release

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Single point failures in non-redundant components:** Implement comprehensive BIT and fault masking
- **Memory corruption during alignment:** Use EDAC scrubbing and checksum verification
- **Synchronization loss during fault recovery:** Employ voted resets and TNR procedures
- **Application-induced timing violations:** Enforce rate group deadlines and overrun detection
- **NE babbling disrupting communications:** Implement packet filtering and channel masking
- **Power-on synchronization failures:** Support degraded operation with 3-of-5 FCRs
- **SEU-induced transient faults:** Continuous RAM scrubbing with 1% CPU budget
- **VxWorks API compatibility issues:** Restrict to certified subset of OS calls
