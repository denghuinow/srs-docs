# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The Tactical Control System (TCS) provides a unified command, control, data receipt, processing, export, and dissemination system interoperable with present and future tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including TUAV and MAE UAV platforms. It supports five levels of UAV interaction, from basic data receipt to full flight control. Non-goals include nuclear safety considerations and proprietary software/hardware solutions.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **UAV Operator**: Controls mission planning, execution, and payload management
- **Maintenance Personnel**: Performs system diagnostics and component maintenance
- **Mission Planner**: Develops and modifies flight routes and sensor plans
- **C4I Interface Operator**: Manages data exchange with external command systems
- **Training Operator**: Conducts simulated mission operations
- **System Administrator**: Performs software upgrades and system configuration

**Main Scenarios**: Mission planning and upload, real-time UAV control, payload data processing, C4I data dissemination
**Exception Scenarios**: Loss of link procedures, emergency recovery, system fault detection

## Business Process
**Main Process (Mission Execution)**:
1. Receive mission tasking
2. Plan flight route and payload parameters
3. Upload mission plan to UAV
4. Launch and monitor UAV
5. Execute real-time control and monitoring
6. Process and exploit payload data
7. Disseminate products to C4I systems
8. Recover UAV

**Key Branch (Loss of Link)**:
1. Detect communication loss
2. Initiate timer and attempt reconnection
3. Execute pre-programmed contingency plan
4. Compute estimated UAV position

**Key Branch (Emergency Recovery)**:
1. Identify emergency condition
2. Initiate recovery procedures
3. Monitor recovery progress
4. Execute abort if required

## Domain Model
- **Mission Plan** (required): flight_route, payload_plan, communications_plan
- **Air Vehicle** (required): vehicle_id, type, status, telemetry_data
- **Payload** (required): payload_type, sensor_data, control_parameters
- **Data Terminal** (required): terminal_id, link_status, frequency
- **C4I Interface** (required): system_type, connection_status, message_queue
- **Map Data** (required): terrain_data, threat_zones, navigation_points
- **System State** (required): operational_mode, fault_status, interaction_level
- **User Account** (required/unique): username, access_level, authentication

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **C4I Systems** (bidirectional): Tactical message exchange, imagery dissemination
- **Data Terminal** (bidirectional): UAV command/control, telemetry reception
- **External Storage** (bidirectional): Mission data import/export
- **Printer** (outbound): Hard copy output of imagery and messages
- **Mission Planning Systems** (inbound): Receive mission plans from service systems
- **Power Supply** (inbound): Standard military power interfaces
- **Geopositional Data** (inbound): Navigation and mapping data sources

## Acceptance Criteria
**Mission Planning**:
- Given a valid flight route is defined, when the operator validates the plan, then the system shall check for altitude constraints and threat zones
- Given an invalid waypoint is entered, when the plan is validated, then the system shall notify the operator of discrepancies

**UAV Control**:
- Given UAV telemetry is being received, when the operator issues flight commands, then the system shall transmit commands via uplink
- Given loss of link occurs, when the timer expires, then the system shall execute contingency procedures

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Process two MAE UAVs simultaneously BLOS; system response <1 second
- **Reliability**: MTBF per UAV ORD requirements; 85% operational availability
- **Security**: DOD 5200.28 compliance; multi-level security accreditation
- **Compliance**: DII/COE, JTA, CIGSS, NITF 2.0 standards
- **Observability**: Comprehensive system state monitoring and event logging

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Phase 1 Program Definition and Risk Reduction (24 months)
2. Level 1-5 interaction demonstration
3. C4I interface integration per priority schedule
4. Operational testing and validation
5. Phase 2 Engineering and Manufacturing Development
6. Low Rate Initial Production commencement

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Single point failures**: Implement redundant systems and fault detection
- **UAV control safety**: Design to prevent unsafe commands from single failures
- **Integration complexity**: Use open architecture and standardized interfaces
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Implement comprehensive security accreditation process
- **Schedule delays**: Incremental development with demonstrable capabilities
- **Technology obsolescence**: Use COTS/GFE components with upgrade paths
- **Training effectiveness**: Embedded training and proficiency measurement
- **Environmental factors**: Design for worldwide operational environments
