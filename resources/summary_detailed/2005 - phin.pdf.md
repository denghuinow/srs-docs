# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The Public Health Information Network (PHIN) Outbreak Management system supports investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of health events and bioterrorism acts. It facilitates data collection and analysis to identify and contain health events through configurable data capture for cases, contacts, investigations, exposures, specimens, laboratory results, and travel history. The system must integrate with early event detection, countermeasure administration, laboratory, and surveillance systems. Non-goals include defining specific transport protocols and implementation details beyond minimum operational requirements.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **Investigator**: Conducts case investigations, traces contacts, creates questionnaires
- **Laboratory Technician**: Processes specimens, generates test results
- **Public Health Official**: Monitors outbreaks, generates reports
- **System Administrator**: Configures system, manages deployments
- **Field Worker**: Collects data in disconnected mode
- **Response Partner**: Exchanges data across jurisdictions

Main scenarios: Case investigation initiation, contact exposure tracing, laboratory test request/result processing, quarantine monitoring
Exception scenarios: Multi-jurisdiction investigation coordination, disconnected mode synchronization, case definition changes

## Business Process
**Main Process (Outbreak Management)**
1. Health event identified and assigned unique Event ID
2. Case investigation initiated with electronic questionnaires
3. Entities (persons, animals, locations) linked to event
4. Specimens collected and sent for laboratory testing
5. Laboratory results received and linked to cases
6. Contact exposure tracing performed
7. Countermeasures administered and monitored
8. Analysis and reporting generated

**Key Branch (Disconnected Operations)**
- Field devices collect investigation data offline
- Data synchronized when connection available
- Conflict resolution during synchronization
- Updated data shared across system instances

**Key Branch (Multi-jurisdiction Investigation)**
- Case reported in one jurisdiction but investigated in another
- Data exchanged between jurisdictional systems
- Coordination through activity logs and contact information
- Aggregate reporting across jurisdictions

## Domain Model
- **Health Event**: Event ID (unique), category, start date, status, case definition (required)
- **Entity**: Subject ID (unique), type (person/animal/location/etc), demographics (required)
- **Case**: Case ID (unique), diagnosis, status, investigation dates, priority (required, references Entity/Health Event)
- **Exposure Contact**: Contact ID, exposure type, dates, health status (required, references Entity)
- **Specimen**: Specimen ID (unique), collection details, subject ID (required, references Entity)
- **Laboratory Result**: Result ID, test type, values, interpretation (required, references Specimen)
- **Questionnaire**: Form ID, questions, revision history (required)
- **Activity Log**: Activity ID, timestamp, user, description (required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **Laboratory Systems**: Inbound/Outbound, Test requests/results, Specimen IDs/test parameters, Result values/interpretations, Real-time processing
- **Surveillance Systems**: Outbound, Case reports, Case classifications/epidemiological data, Aggregate counts, Daily batch exchange
- **Countermeasure Systems**: Bidirectional, Administration requests/records, Patient identifiers/treatment details, Administration confirmations, Near real-time
- **Early Event Detection**: Inbound, Event notifications, Suspect case data, Alert triggers, Immediate processing
- **Public Health Directory**: Inbound, Partner contact information, Organization details, Contact records, Periodic updates
- **Field Devices**: Bidirectional, Data synchronization, Investigation records, Sync confirmations, Connection-based
- **Analytical Tools**: Outbound, Data export, Standard formats (SAS/Excel), Analysis files, On-demand

## Acceptance Criteria
**Case Investigation**
- Given an investigator with proper credentials, when they access the case investigation module, then they can create and configure electronic questionnaires for data collection

**Laboratory Integration**
- Given a specimen has been collected, when a laboratory test is requested, then the system generates a standardized test request message and links results to the original specimen

**Contact Tracing**
- Given a confirmed case exists, when contact exposure tracing is initiated, then the system identifies all exposed entities and creates monitoring worklists sorted by priority

**Disconnected Operations**
- Given field workers are operating in disconnected mode, when they reconnect to the system, then their data synchronizes with central servers without conflicts

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Support 100+ concurrent investigators; Laboratory result processing within 5 minutes
- **Reliability**: 99.5% system availability; Data synchronization success rate >98%
- **Security**: Role-based access control; Encrypted data transmission
- **Compliance**: HIPAA privacy adherence; PHIN vocabulary standards compliance
- **Observability**: Comprehensive activity logging; Real-time system monitoring

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Core case investigation and entity management
2. Laboratory integration and specimen tracking
3. Contact exposure tracing and monitoring
4. Multi-jurisdiction data exchange
5. Advanced analytics and visualization
6. Full disconnected operations support

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Synchronization Conflicts**: Implement conflict resolution protocols and version control
- **Multi-jurisdiction Coordination**: Establish clear data sharing agreements and standards
- **System Configuration Complexity**: Provide configuration templates and training
- **Vocabulary Standard Adoption**: Maintain flexible mapping between local and standard terminologies
- **Privacy Breaches**: Implement strict access controls and audit trails
- **Disconnected Operation Failures**: Develop robust offline capabilities and sync validation
- **Laboratory Integration Delays**: Use standardized message formats and testing protocols
- **Performance Under Load**: Conduct load testing and implement scaling strategies
