# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The HATS Graphical User Interface (HATS-GUI) is a platform-independent interface for the High Assurance Transformation System (HATS), which enables transformation-based software development through provably correct program transformations. The system allows users to prepare applications, execute transformations, and examine outputs in both Syntax Derivation Tree (SDT) and pretty-printed text formats. Non-goals include handling multiple simultaneous users and providing extensive user guidance, as users are expected to be domain experts familiar with transformations and software tools.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **User**: Domain expert who interacts with HATS-GUI to prepare applications, execute transformations, and view outputs
- **HATS-SML**: Backend service providing parsing, transformation, and pretty-printing functions
- **Host OS**: Provides file services and process management

Key use cases include: Parse transformation programs/targets, Execute transformations, Select applications/files, Prepare applications (create/edit/save), Configure application settings, Display SDT outputs, Display pretty-printed text, and Generate pretty-printed output from SDTs.

## Business Process
**Main Process (Execute Transformation):**
1. User selects transformation language program
2. System validates parser currency
3. System validates parsed program currency
4. System identifies target files
5. System validates target parsing
6. System executes transformation
7. System captures outputs/errors
8. System makes outputs available for viewing

**Key Branches:**
- **Parser Generation**: Triggered when parser is outdated/missing; involves generating parser from grammar/lexical specs
- **File Parsing**: Triggered when parsed files are outdated; involves parsing transformation programs or targets using generated parser

## Domain Model
- **Application** (name, directory_path - required/unique)
- **File** (name, extension, path, timestamp - required)
- **Configuration** (editor_associations, node_display_settings, expansion_levels - required)
- **SDT** (filename, root_node - required)
- **DisplayedNode** (type, color, shape, label - required)
- **TransformationProgram** (filename, parsed_version - required)
- **TargetFile** (filename, parsed_version - required)
- **PrettyPrintStyle** (filename, associations - required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **HATS-SML** (Outbound): Execute transformation services; Input: file paths and parameters; Output: SDTs, text, errors; SLA: Process completion codes
- **Host OS** (Outbound): File operations and process management; Input: file paths, editor commands; Output: file lists, process status; SLA: Standard OS file operations
- **Host OS Clipboard** (Bidirectional): Copy/paste operations; Input: selected text; Output: system buffer content; SLA: Standard clipboard operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Execute Transformation**: Given a valid transformation program and target files, when the user executes the transformation, then the system generates output SDTs and makes them available for viewing
- **Display SDT**: Given a generated SDT file, when the user selects to view it, then the system displays a navigable graphical representation with associated leaf text
- **Configure Application**: Given an open application, when the user modifies display settings, then the system saves the configuration and applies it to subsequent displays

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Display 10,000-node SDTs in ≤5 seconds; Maintain O(n²) complexity for search algorithms
- **Reliability**: Continue operation despite HATS-SML errors; Support concurrent user activities during transformations
- **Security**: No authentication required
- **Compliance**: Platform independence across Windows 2000, Solaris, Linux
- **Observability**: Collect and display all HATS-SML error messages in dedicated window

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Core application management functionality
2. Basic HATS-SML integration for parsing
3. Transformation execution capability
4. SDT display and navigation
5. Pretty-printed text display
6. Configuration management and final integration

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **HATS-SML version delays**: Maintain communication with HATS development team; implement mock services for testing
- **Performance with large SDTs**: Implement efficient tree rendering algorithms; test with benchmark datasets
- **Platform compatibility issues**: Early testing on target platforms; use standard Java libraries
- **Complex search requirements**: Prototype search algorithms; validate with sample grammars
- **File synchronization errors**: Implement robust timestamp checking; provide user override options
- **Memory management**: Implement lazy loading for large trees; monitor memory usage
- **User interface complexity**: Conduct usability testing with domain experts; provide sensible defaults
- **Integration testing**: Develop comprehensive test suite; coordinate with HATS-SML team
