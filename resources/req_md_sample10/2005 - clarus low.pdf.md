INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Purpose 
The purpose of this requirements specification is to provide a repository for the 
high-level and detailed requirements governing the design of the Clarus system. 
These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept 
of Operations (ConOps), in meetings with potential users and participants, and in 
subsequent documents identified below. These requirements will form the basis 
for the design verification and validation of the system. The intended audience for 
this document includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers. 
This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system 
requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system. 
As indicated in the highlighted box in Figure 1, the Detailed Systems 
Requirements Specification (DRS) is an intermediate deliverable in the larger 
context of the Clarus Weather System Design project, using criteria documented 
in the Concept of Operations, High-Level Requirements Specification, Survey of 
Environmental Sensor Stations, Analysis of COTS Systems, Analysis 
Architectural Alternatives Analysis, and the Design Gaps Analysis as input to the 
DRS.

1.2 
Scope  
Clarus is an initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. 
DOT) to organize and make more effective environmental and road condition 
observation capabilities in support of four primary motivations. 
1) Provide a North American resource to collect, quality check, and make 
available surface transportation weather and road condition observations 
so that State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and other 
transportation agencies can be more productive in maintaining safety and 
mobility on all roads and surface transportation platforms. In addition to 
increasing productivity, it will maximize their RWIS/ESS investments. 
2) Surface transportation-based weather observations will enhance and 
extend the existing weather data sources that support general purpose 
weather forecasting for the protection of life and property. 
3) Collection of real-time surface transportation-based weather observations 
will support real-time operational responses to weather. 
4) Surface transportation-based weather observations integrated with existing 
observation data will permit broader support for the enhancement and 
creation of models that make better predictions in the atmospheric 
boundary layer and near the earth’s surface to support more accurate 
forecasts. 
The intent of the Clarus Initiative is to demonstrate how an open and integrated 
approach to observational data management can be used to collect, control the 
quality of, and consolidate surface transportation environmental data. The Clarus 
Initiative will address the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a 
multitude of independent data collection systems. This process offers the prospect 
of enhancing data coverage, improving the performance of meteorological support 
services, and providing guidance to owners of these data sources regarding the 
quality of their data and performance of their data collection systems. 
Clarus represents the next step in bringing together surface transportation best 
practices 
and 
the 
greater 
weather 
community. 
Surface 
transportation 
environmental data collected by the Clarus system will include atmospheric data, 
pavement data1, and hydrologic (water level) data. 
The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components.  
• The first component is the development of the Clarus system – a network 
for sharing, quality checking, and exchanging surface environmental data 
and relevant surface transportation conditions.  
• The second component is the development of tools (such as decision 
support systems) that make effective use of the Clarus system.  
                                                 
1 “Pavement data” in this context includes surface and subsurface data specified in NTCIP 1204 (Ref. 8).

The addition of Clarus system data to national weather observations will further 
enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing a wider range of benefits 
to the protection of life and property. 
Data from the Clarus system will have a wide variety of direct and indirect uses. 
Users having the most immediate contact with the Clarus system will include the 
owners and operators of the observing systems that are providing information to 
the Clarus system, as well as the users directly accessing the data contained 
within the Clarus system. The following is an initial list — which will likely grow 
as the initiative progresses — of these stakeholders: 
• Observation system owners including federal, state, local, and private 
institutions; 
• Instrument and observation platform suppliers; 
• Direct data users including system owners and their contractors; 
• Surface transportation weather service providers (which may include the 
observation system owners – e.g., state DOTs); 
• The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); 
• General weather service providers; 
• Research and engineering community; and 
• Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests. 
The deployed Clarus system is envisioned to include: 
• A one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation environmental 
observations; 
• Data provided with and without post-processing, ready to be incorporated 
into value-added products including weather and traffic models as well as 
decision support systems; 
• Continuous quality checking of data with feedback to operators of the 
originating sensor stations; 
• Data transferred in one common protocol with full metadata; 
• Management of users’ rights to input or extract specific data components; 
• Data retrieval tools; and 
• Support for the inclusion of new technologies such as vehicle-based 
sensors, surface visibility information from traffic cameras, and remote 
sensing technologies.

Some portions of the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref. 12) have been 
incorporated in this document, both for continuity of concept, and to help identify 
the basis for the high-level and detailed requirements. Specific attributions of this 
content are only included where they enhance the context of the requirements. 
1.5 
Overview  
The organization and content of this document is generally based on the IEEE 
standards for System Requirements Specifications (Ref. 13). The requirements 
presented in this document represent the high-level and detailed objectives, 
constraints, and desires for the Clarus system. 
Each requirement is identified by a unique Clarus-specific identifier to allow the 
requirement to be referenced in future documents, providing traceability 
throughout the development process. Each detailed requirement is traced to its 
parent through its identification number followed by a unique identifier. 
A requirements document states what must be accomplished to fulfill the vision 
described in a concept of operations. It does not state how it is to be 
accomplished. This document describes each requirement and the basis for 
inclusion of that requirement.  
The remaining sections of the document contain the requirements for the system. 
The sections and their content are as follows:  
Section 2 – General Description provides a general overview of the 
entire system. This section describes the general factors that affect the 
system and its requirements. 
Section 3 – System Architecture provides an overview of the Clarus 
system’s components and their functions. Specific requirements in the 
next section are allocated to and organized according to these components. 
Section 4 – Specific Requirements contains the requirements developed 
from reference documentation and stakeholder communications. This 
section organizes the requirements into categories that facilitate the system

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general 
factors that affect the system and its requirements. This section does not state 
specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to 
understand by giving them context. That context and the overall intent of the 
Clarus program are described in detail in the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref. 
12), from which much of the description in this section was derived.  
2.1 
System Perspective  
The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create a “network of networks” — 
much like the Internet — for surface transportation environmental data. While the 
Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an 
interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) 
data collection networks. Each of the weather networks will function 
autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without 
direction or dependence on Clarus. 
Each participating weather network’s connection to Clarus will add two new 
possible modes of functionality. First, the participants will be able to share 
collected environmental data with Clarus. Second, participants will be able to 
receive environmental data collected by Clarus. The primary recipients of this 
data will be weather service providers, but any Clarus participants would be able 
to receive data if they so chose. This concept of autonomous data sharing is 
comparable to the World Wide Web layer of the Internet, where organizations can 
publish information on web pages, or browse and download information 
published by other organizations on the web. Ownership of the data is retained by 
the organization that provided the data to Clarus, and the provider organization 
can restrict the dissemination of the data through data sharing agreements with the 
Clarus program. 
The Clarus system will add a third mode of functionality, which might be called 
“meta-librarian.” The Clarus system will collect, organize, and quality check the 
environmental data to be published by the system. The data will be collected from 
the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be 
added. When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and 
other participant/consumers in Clarus. Figure 2 shows the general process as data 
progresses from collection through publication to service providers.

Figure 2 – Clarus Data Acquisition, Processing, and Publication 
The principal interfaces that will be critical to Clarus are the interface between 
Clarus and the participating collectors, and the interface between Clarus and the 
participating service providers. MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a 
standard interchange format. While the service provider interface is completely 
within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be 
influenced by what interfaces these systems can support. 
While the participants may want to access the network through “a one-stop 
Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related 
observations” (Ref. 12), there is no requirement that the system be a single 
centralized system. Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized 
architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a 
“one-stop” portal. 
The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed. While 
some data retention is likely to be necessary to support the quality checking 
function and the publication function, there is a clear recognition that as the data 
age, they lose value to all but climatological investigators and other researchers. 
This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of 
environmental data in Clarus. Considering the technical scope of such an effort, 
archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is 
operational and proven.

2.2 
System Functions  
The Clarus system will collect data from contributing members, organize and 
quality check the data, and then publish the data for use by service providers and 
other members of the network. These basic processes are shown in Figure 3 in 
terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions. The ellipses represent 
specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the 
interactions between them2. For example, a “Collector” administers a “Sensor,” 
collects “Observation Data,” provides “Sensor Metadata,” and receives “Quality 
Feedback”.
                                                 
2 The arrows in Figure 3 do not indicate data flows; they show the subject-object orientation of the 
relationship.

The volume of data involved in this process has the potential to become very 
large, which leads to a significant challenge in developing a system that can 
effectively gather, organize, quality check, and disseminate the data. The Clarus 
system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data 
in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.  
Determining data types will be a significant challenge. Proper understanding of 
the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data 
gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest 
efficiency. 
While there are many types of environmental data that could be collected, the 
Clarus emphasis on surface weather and transportation puts the focus on those 
weather elements that have a direct bearing on surface transportation systems. 
These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP 1204 standard for 
Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref. 8) and summarized in Table 
1 as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system.

There are basic temporal limits for the data collection, quality checking, 
processing, and publication of the environmental data. There is also a period for 
which the Service Provider Customers have temporal-driven requirements. The 
design of Clarus will need to consider these time horizons when planning the 
technical limitations of the system architecture. These data time horizons are 
illustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4 – Time Horizons for Weather Data 
The average elapsed time for the Autonomous Layer varies as a result of 
configuration and communications latencies that are inherent within the operation 
of the system to collect the data. The Clarus component includes the time 
required to communicate data from the Autonomous Layer to the Clarus system 
import process as well as the time required to process the input data into storage 
structures. Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the 
time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and 
machine-based product generation. The average data age grows as a result of the 
aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to 
the Service Provider Customers. The Clarus system design must address how best 
to minimize these times to optimize the flow of data in a timely manner. 
For the purposes of defining the boundaries of these time horizons, the following 
definitions apply: 
• Average Elapsed Time is the estimated time for the process within a 
given layer or layer subdivision to take place. The age of observed and 
recorded values can vary widely within these bands. 
• Average Data Age is the estimated average age of an ESS observation as 
it is transferred from the ESS to the end user.

2.3 
User Characteristics  
Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a wide audience. 
Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is 
necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with 
the system components. 
The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing 
systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly 
accessing the data published by the Clarus system.  
The following is an initial list of stakeholders whose user needs are considered: 
• Observation system owners including federal, state, local, and private 
institutions; 
• Instrument and observation platform suppliers; 
• Direct data users including system owners and their contractors; 
• Surface transportation weather service providers (which may include the 
observation system owners); 
• NOAA; 
• General weather service providers; 
• Research and engineering community; and 
• 
Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests. 
This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire 
population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative. The requirements of 
the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these 
interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system. From information 
in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements 
(STWDSR) (Ref. 5), Weather Information for Surface Transportation (WIST) 
(Ref. 6), and 511 Deployment Coalition (Ref. 7) documents, it is possible to 
separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user’s interface 
or interaction with Clarus data.  
The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from 
raw field observations to various levels of data use. This is illustrated in Figure 5.

Figure 5 – Clarus User Layers and Time Horizon Relationships 
The Autonomous Layer is comprised of operational entities who utilize weather 
and transportation data to make plans, decisions, and/or take action based upon 
sensor data within their control. These data include observations collected by 
ESS, mobile data acquisition platforms, cameras, and other transportation-related 
measurement devices. The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of 
the raw input data to the Clarus system. 
The Clarus Layer lies between the Autonomous and Service Providers Layers 
and represents the nationwide system and architecture to accomplish the 
previously outlined goals of surface transportation environmental data collection 
and management.  
The Service Providers Layer is composed of both public and private entities that 
provide basic and value-added weather support services to support the weather 
information needs of the broader surface transportation community. These support 
services rely on Clarus data (raw and processed) combined with other

environmental, road condition, or traffic information products to develop or 
provide road weather information and enhanced products.  
The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct 
consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a 
direct user of Clarus data. The members of this group could be anyone using 
weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation 
community. The weather products received by these end users are built from a 
combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data. In some instances, the Service 
Provider Customer Layer includes entities and agencies also found within the 
Autonomous Layer who receive quality checking information on the data they 
originally provided to Clarus. 
Figure 5 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the 
stakeholder groups. There is an inherent time scale, similar to Figure 4, emanating 
from the center of the diagram outward, representing the flow and processing of 
data through the Clarus system and between the layers.  
The context diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the entities 
interfacing with Clarus. The diagram also describes the flow of data between the 
entities and the Clarus system. The data provider organizations maintain data 
collection systems. These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer — the 
primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system. These 
stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from 
the Clarus system. The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data 
with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds.

The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users. 
These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information 
services for the transportation community. Additional Service Providers having 
direct access to Clarus data resources include research organizations, external 
agencies that may choose to archive Clarus data, and other related weather 
service providers.  
Within the context of Figure 6, the following roles can be assigned to each group 
of users: 
• 
Federal, State, and Local Agencies – These are the transportation system 
and road weather information system (RWIS) operators and owners who 
directly provide the Clarus data. This group places considerable emphasis 
on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level 
to make immediate decisions. These users, primarily maintenance and 
operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided 
by surface transportation weather service providers. Additional data from 
this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road 
condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing 
and chemical application. 
• Transit – These are the owners and operators of transit systems who 
contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-
controlled data from it. This group places considerable emphasis on 
understanding weather conditions along designated routes. 
• Rail – These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute 
raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data 
from it. This group places considerable emphasis on understanding 
weather conditions along designated routes plus weather-induced specifics 
such as rail temperatures, frozen switches, icing on electrical power 
distribution systems, and drifting snow. 
• Vehicle – Emerging technologies are developing that will encourage a 
greater level of data collection from vehicles for the purpose of 
understanding the nature of the transportation system state including the 
impacts of weather. As this method of data collection matures, the 
information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from 
instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data. 
• Surface Transportation Weather Service Providers (STWSP) – These 
surface transportation weather service providers are the private and public 
weather service providers who assimilate the Clarus data with other 
available data to generate value-added products and services used by the 
surface transportation decision-makers at state and local transportation 
agencies. 
• Weather Service Providers – These include the weather support services 
that are primarily interested in the meteorological and hydrologic 
components of the Clarus data. This group includes the efforts in public 
forecasting by NOAA and the National Weather Service (NWS) along

with private sector weather services and their value-added support to 
markets such as agriculture, power utilities, and construction. 
• Research – This category incorporates federal, academic, and private 
sector researchers who are working to improve the state of knowledge and 
practice through the research of surface transportation weather. 
• Archives – This category includes operational and non-operational 
interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors. The 
archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other 
meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted 
to such efforts. 
2.4 
General Constraints 
Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on 
the design. Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system 
architecture and implementation.  
To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can 
both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and 
at potentially high rates. An architecture that spreads its data collection and 
dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may 
address this issue. The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the 
system to expand and add new data sources and end-users. 
Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment 
considerations. Hardware, operating system, and development environment have 
significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system. To maximize system 
uptime, redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of 
the system. The primary challenge here will be the trade-off between the desire 
for reliability and the cost of redundancies.  
While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the 
criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed. Since Clarus is not replacing 
any existing application, the system is not currently critical to any operation or 
transportation function; neither is it intended to support any “critical national 
security missions.”3 Nonetheless, once the Clarus system is operational, many 
DOTs will use the environmental data from the Clarus system in their normal 
management and operations of their infrastructure. If the Clarus system fails, 
requestors will need to use their legacy systems.  
The system will be “open,” using architecture and communications interfaces that 
are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology 
industry. The system should be standards based, where national standards are 
applicable. Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent 
transportation system (ITS) standards. 
                                                 
3 Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance of Reference 14, OMB Circular No. 
A-130, which, by its own definition, does not apply to “critical national security missions.” Future 
applications of Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification.

2.5 
Assumptions and Dependencies  
The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple 
environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers. While 
the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing 
network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data 
sources. Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not 
justify the cost of operating the system. 
Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental 
data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data. Data not collected in a 
timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers. Assumptions have 
also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing 
systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags. 
Accepting data from contributors who cannot provide these tags with the data 
could seriously complicate the design of the data acquisition interfaces. 
Even though the system will check the data and apply quality flags, consumers of 
Clarus-provided data will need to understand that neither FHWA nor the 
contributing data providers will accept responsibility for the accuracy of any of 
the data. The particular limitations and conditions will be defined in data sharing 
agreements to be established with data providers, and disclaimer information will 
be made available to data consumers by whatever means the data are published. 
Several requirements deal with “regional” needs, without specifying regional 
boundaries. It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems 
will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer 
systems. It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different 
(though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks. Data consumers 
will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not 
by regional boundaries. Consumers will also need to understand that coverage 
will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing 
organizations. 
The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data 
collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system. 
Data in the system database and in published data sets will likely include geo-
reference coordinates in decimal longitude, latitude, and elevation. 
The availability, format, and precision of time/date stamps could also present 
unusual problems for the data acquisition system, particularly if contributing 
systems cannot manage Daylight Savings Time (DST), span time zones, or span 
areas that do and do not participate in DST. Clarus timestamps for data in the 
database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time 
reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 
The base assumption regarding “database tools” is that the selected data storage 
software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and 
configuration and management tools. No special database tools will be developed 
as a part of the Clarus system. Some tools may developed in the future as part of 
ongoing Clarus Initiative activities.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
The process of generating detailed system requirements has two major parts: 
allocating the high-level requirements to specific system components, and 
elaborating the requirements on the function and interchange between those 
components. The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed 
in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this 
section. Figure 7, taken from that document, represents the general structure and 
flow of information within the Clarus system.

Figure 7 – Data Flows within the Clarus System 
Four of the components in Figure 7 are modeled as sets of services: the collector, 
quality checking (QCh), qualified environmental data, and environmental 
metadata services. The collector, QED, and EM services are sets of services 
because each individual service represents a particular data format interface. A set 
of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and 
outgoing environmental information. The particular collector, QED, or EM 
service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the 
environmental data. 
The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service. It is a set 
of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that 
can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus. The specific algorithms 
and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules 
established through the configuration & administration service. This arrangement 
supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best 
possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system.

There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and 
schedule services. The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and 
restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service 
disruption. The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data 
from collectors and contributors. The schedule service will also prioritize and 
respond to subscription requests for environmental data (not depicted in Figure 
7). 
The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data 
from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods. Each 
collector service is capable of understanding a particular data format and is 
responsible for extracting the environmental data and placing it into the qualified 
environmental data cache flagged as unqualified environmental data.  
Quality rules set up by the configuration & administration service are executed by 
the quality checking services to apply sets of computations on the environmental 
data stored in the qualified environmental data cache. Flagging out-of-range 
values is one example of a quality rule. Other quality rules could be created to 
derive environmental conditions from existing information such as dew point. 
Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could 
apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data. 
This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process. The 
QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality 
and can be continuously delivered. 
The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from 
and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users. 
Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and 
metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers. Each of these 
components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a 
particular data format. 
The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and 
program. It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions 
and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED 
retrieval schedules. The configuration & administration service manages environ-
mental metadata, formatting it for internal storage. Data transactions and system 
operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user 
interface as well. The configuration and administration user interface allows 
administrative users to interact with these functions and supports the manual 
quality review processes.

4 
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS 
This section presents the high-level and detailed requirements for the Clarus 
system and the associated institutional program necessary to achieve the needs 
and goals described by the Concept of Operations. These requirements describe 
the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to 
specific components within the Clarus system. The high-level requirements in 
this document are limited to those that can be derived from a context diagram 
(Figure 8) that pictures the Clarus system as a single functional block with its 
interfaces. The types of high-level requirements described in this section 
correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces. Functional requirements 
describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking, 
development, and packaging of environmental data. Each interface to the Clarus 
system has its own requirements with regard to the collection of data from 
providers as input; the dissemination of data for output; the controlling rules and 
constraints under which the system operates; and the means (primarily data 
management) by which it works. 
 
Figure 8 – High-Level Requirements Context 
The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for 
downstream development activities. The high-level requirements provide a basis 
for components in system elaboration, and detailed requirements are subsequently 
tied to specific components. Conformance to high-level requirements is shown 
through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements. The entire 
development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high-
level requirements. 
In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement 
identification as described in Table 2 and shown in Table 3. 
• Functional Requirements – Lists the characteristics that the system must 
support for each interface. Identifies what is to be done by the system,

what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific 
operations are required. The functional requirements further include: 
• Functional Data Requirements, which describe requirements 
specific to the definition and management of data used and 
provided by the system; and 
• Functional Interface Requirements, which describe the functional 
interfaces to the Clarus system from information providers and 
consumers. 
• Performance Requirements – Specifies static and dynamic capacity for the 
number of users, connections, and other performance related factors. 
Performance requirements further include: 
• Design Constraints, which identify constraints imposed by 
standards, regulations, software or hardware limitations; and 
• Quality Requirements, which provide requirements which address 
the general quality, usability, extensibility, flexibility, and 
maintainability of the system. 
• Organizational Requirements – Includes requirements for policies and 
procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and 
institutional requirements to support the system. This category also:  
• Details logical characteristics between the system and external data 
sources; 
• Specifies level of integration with external systems and defines the 
interfaces with each user class; and 
• Specifies any communications interfaces and protocols that should 
be supported. 
Table 2 shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the 
purpose or content of each column of the requirements table. The requirements in 
this document are a subset of the requirements information that will be tracked in 
the system “Requirements Matrix.” While this document is intended to record the 
requirements that apply to a particular implementation of the system, the 
Requirements Matrix tracks all proposed requirements for the system. The matrix 
includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the system or which 
have been deferred due to cost or complexity. 
Table 3 provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering 
system. The high-level requirements are identified as A-NNN, where A is the 
classification and NNN is a unique number. The detailed requirements are 
identified as A-NNNUU, where A-NNN is the parent or high-level requirement 
and UU is a unique identifier. 
This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support. It 
also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be 
transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required. The

functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific 
modules listed in Table 4. 
Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement. 
They are used by developers in creating the design for the Clarus system, by 
testers to ensure all requirements are implemented during the build of the Clarus 
system, and by the client for documenting their expectations.  
Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or 
component of the Clarus system. Within each table, the high-level requirements 
show their allocations to particular modules. If the high-level requirement is 
allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be 
repeated in the corresponding allocation’s module. 
Following the high-level requirement, detailed requirement(s) are shown to create 
more refined requirements specific to the associated module. Figure 7 may be 
referenced while reviewing the detailed requirements to maintain context of the 
Clarus system’s architecture.

APPENDIX B - SUPPLEMENTAL DESCRIPTION OF 
CLARUS QC TESTS 
 
The Clarus detailed requirements describe QC tests to be implemented as Clarus 
standard tests. This appendix provides descriptions of these QC test methods as a 
means of clarifying the intended implementations. These descriptions should not 
be interpreted, however, as further elaborations of requirements or as design 
specifications. The Clarus system design descriptions will provide the final 
specifications and will be subject to formal design review. 
Manual Quality Test 
The Clarus manual quality test allows authorized Clarus personnel to flag 
particular observations as “passed” or “failed” independent of the automated 
analysis. For instance, if a network manager communicates to Clarus that one of 
its stations has a temperature bias, then that station’s temperature data can be 
manually flagged as “failed” until the network corrects the problem. If a Clarus 
QA meteorologist determines that suspicious-looking snow depth data are from a 
real, meteorological event, that station’s snow depth can be manually flagged as 
“passed” until the event ends. Observations that have received manual quality 
checks need not be run through the automated quality checks (Fiebrich and 
Crawford 2001). 
Sensor Range Test 
The Clarus range test will flag any observation that lies outside of the pre-
determined range threshold values as “failed”. The threshold values will usually 
be determined via sensor specifications or theoretical limits (Meek and Hatfield 
1994). For instance, the range for relative humidity would likely be 0 to 100%. 
Observations that have received range filter flags of “failed” need not be run 
through the automated quality checks. 
Climate Test 
The Clarus climate test will flag any observation that exceeds defined, variable-
specific climatological ranges as “failed” (Reek et al., 1992). Otherwise, the 
observation will be flagged as “passed”. The Clarus climatological threshold 
values will be station-specific and will be based on either regional extremes or 
individual station extremes (if they are available). 
Barnes Spatial Test 
The Clarus Barnes spatial test will calculate an estimate for each observation 
using a one-pass Barnes objective analysis routine (Barnes 1964, Shafer et al. 
2000). Neighboring observations will be weighted according to their distance 
from the station that is being estimated: 
Ze =
w(ri)zi
∑
w(ri)
∑
,

where Ze is the estimated value, zi are the neighboring observations, and w is the 
weighting, based on the neighboring site’s distance to the site in question. The 
weighting decreases exponentially with distance from the station: 
W (ri) = e
−ri
2
ko . 
The weight function, ko, is determined by the Barnes analysis based upon the 
mean station spacing. The standard deviation, σ, of the observations within the 
radius of influence is calculated. The ratio of the difference between the observed 
(Zo) and estimated (Ze) values to the analysis’ standard deviation is defined as: 
∆= Ze −Zo
σ
. 
The Clarus Barnes spatial test will fail any observation whose value differs by 
more than three standard deviations from its estimated value (i.e., ∆ > 3). 
Otherwise, the Clarus Barnes spatial test will pass the observation, and list the ∆ 
value with the QC flag to indicate the confidence in the observation. For instance, 
a ∆ value of 1.5 would indicate that the observation was within 1.5 standard 
deviations of its expected value. Further analysis may indicate that the Barnes 
spatial test should have the ability to incorporate background fields (e.g., ADAS 
or RUC analysis from the previous hour) into the analysis to compensate for 
regions that have inadequate spatial or temporal coverage. 
Optimal Interpolation Spatial Test 
The Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test will calculate an estimate for each 
observation using a univariate optimal-interpolation technique (Belousov et al., 
1968). Specifically, the test will use the nearest observation in each of eight 
directional sectors distributed around the observation (Miller and Benjamin, 
1992). If the difference between the observation and estimate is “small”, the 
observation is flagged as “passed”, and the difference between the observation 
and the estimate is listed to indicate the confidence in the observation. The 
threshold for “small” is a function of the expected analysis error, which is 
dependent on location and density of the neighboring observations (Gandin, 1963, 
and Miller and Benjamin, 1991). If the difference is large, then neighboring 
observations are successively eliminated from the analysis to determine whether 
the discrepancy was caused by an erroneous observation from a neighboring site. 
If successively eliminating a neighboring station from the analysis results in a 
value that agrees with the observation, then the observation is flagged as 
“passed”. The difference between the observation and the estimate indicates the 
confidence in the observation. In addition, the suspicious neighboring observation 
is not used in the analysis of other stations. If successive eliminations of 
neighboring stations does not result in an estimated value that agrees with the 
observation, the observation is flagged as “failed”. 
The Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial check will incorporate a background 
field (e.g., ADAS or RUC analysis from the previous hour) into the analysis to 
compensate for regions that have inadequate spatial or temporal coverage. Miller

and Benjamin (1992) found that subtracting the background field before 
performing the analysis improved error detection.  
Step Test 
The Clarus step test will flag all observations whose consecutive values in time 
exceed predefined variable-specific step threshold values as “failed” (Fiebrich and 
Crawford 2001). For instance, if a pressure observation changes by greater than 
10 hPa in five minutes, the observation is flagged as “failed”. As another 
example, if a temperature observation changes by greater than 10 °C in five 
minutes, the observation would be flagged as “failed”. 
Persistence Test 
The Clarus persistence test will flag all observations whose consecutive values in 
time remain the same for a predefined variable-specific persistence threshold 
value during a defined time interval as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological 
Survey). For instance, if a pressure observation remains unchanged (to the nearest 
pascal) for more than 30 minutes, the observation would be flagged as “failed”. 
As another example, if a temperature observation remains unchanged (to the 
nearest tenth of a °C) for more than 120 minutes, the observation would be 
flagged as “failed”. 
Like Instrument Test 
The Clarus like instrument test will flag all observations that differ from the 
corresponding like-instrument observations by more than a predefined variable-
specific threshold value as “failed” (Fiebrich and Crawford 2001). For instance, if 
the wind speed at 10 m differs from the wind speed at 2 m by more than 5 ms-1, 
then the observation would be flagged as “failed”. 
Potential Temperature Test 
The Clarus potential temperature test will flag all temperature observations whose 
potential temperatures fail the Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test as 
“failed”. Elevation differences will be incorporated to help model the horizontal 
correlation between mountain stations (Miller and Benjamin 1992). 
Dew Point Temperature Test 
The Clarus dew point temperature test will flag all temperature and relative 
humidity observations whose resulting dew point values fail the Clarus Barnes 
spatial test or the Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test as “failed” (Oklahoma 
Climatological Survey). 
Sea Level Pressure Test 
The Clarus sea level pressure test will flag all pressure observations whose 
computed sea level pressure values fail the Clarus Barnes spatial test or the 
Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological 
Survey).

Theoretical Solar Radiation Test 
The Clarus theoretical solar radiation test will flag all downwelling short wave 
radiation observations whose values exceed the theoretical solar radiation for the 
site’s latitude, longitude, and day of year as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological 
Survey). 
Precipitation Amount Test 
The Clarus precipitation amount test would flag all precipitation amount 
observations whose values differ from the radar-estimated precipitation amount 
by more than a pre-determined threshold as “failed”. The nearest or best radar to 
use for each location would be configurable. This technique is still being 
researched and is not recommended for Clarus proof-of-concept implementation 
(Oklahoma Climatological Survey). 
Wind Direction Test 
The Clarus wind direction test will function the same way as the Barnes and 
Optimal Interpolation spatial tests do, with the exception that wind direction 
estimates will be calculated from directional means (rather than arithmetic 
means). In addition, the wind direction observation will be subject to this test only 
if its associated wind speed observations are greater than 3 ms-1 (Oklahoma 
Climatological Survey). For instance, wind directions with associated wind 
speeds of 0-3 ms-1 will not be tested, because wind direction is highly variable 
during calm/light winds. 
Soil Moisture Change Test 
The Clarus soil moisture change test will function similarly to the step test except 
that different thresholds will be set for changes in moistening versus drying. For 
instance, the observations will be allowed to moisten more rapidly than they will 
be allowed to dry (Oklahoma Climatological Survey 2005). 
Soil Moisture Freeze Test 
The Clarus soil moisture freeze test will flag all observations whose associated 
subsurface temperatures are below freezing as “failed”. Most soil moisture 
sensors do not operate correctly when the soil is frozen (Oklahoma Climatological 
Survey 2005).
