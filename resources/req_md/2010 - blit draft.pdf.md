1 Introduction
The management of [company name]. has identified a potential need for re-writing its core 
Laboratory Information System (LIS) to improve the performance. In general, this project 
will provide a stable environment, automate decisions, streamline workflows, and employ 
industry standard coding and documentation practices. This effort will ensure System 
Integrity/Reliability by developing a system that is reliable and low maintenance including 
security and confidentiality requirements as dictated by HIPAA and FDA regulatory 
standards.
1.1 Purpose
This Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) is intended to capture the changes in 
functionality that will occur during [system name] Re-Writing effort, which is part of the xxx 
Enhancements project. All functionalities for the new [system name] system would be 
documented in this FRS. Any undocumented requirements will be considered out of scope 
and will not be implemented during this phase of Re-Writing.
1.2 Scope
The existing functionalities in the core [system name] will remain same. This project is 
limited in scope to the enhancements and defects that are critical in the severity level that is 
the issues that cause great burden to the system users and the enhancements in system 
architecture, which will facilitate efficient growth of [system name] and the [company name] 
business, will fall under the purview of this project scope.
The functional issues and requirements that will be discussed and gathered respectively as 
well as validated in the Requirements Gathering and Validating Sessions started on 
MM/DD/YYYYwould be documented in this FRS moving forward. The project team has 
decided that system development will occur on module by module basis.
