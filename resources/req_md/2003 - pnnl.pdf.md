Software Requirements Specification  
1. 
Introduction 
This document specifies requirements for a computerized automated diagnostic tool for the detection of 
faults in certain heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system components.  The automated 
diagnostic tool is being developed for Architectural Energy Corporation (AEC) by Battelle as part of a 
program sponsored by the California Energy Commission (CEC).  Supplemental cost-share funds are 
provided by U.S. Department of Energy through the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). 
1.1 
Purpose 
This Requirements Specification (RS) specifies the essential capabilities required of the automated 
diagnostic tool. The purpose of this document is to clarify for AEC, the California Energy Commission 
(CEC), the Office of Buildings Programs, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERN) of 
the U.S. Department of Energy, and the project team the results that must be achieved by the automated 
diagnostic tool.  Any illustrative model presented in this document is used solely to explain the 
requirements and is NOT intended to address design or implementation issues. 
 
This SRS also specifies key AEC, CEC, and EERN requirements for project deliverables, including 
documentation. 
1.2 
Scope 
The automated diagnostic tool detects and identifies faults in chillers and cooling tower subsystems of 
HVAC units using sensed data acquired from the unit, unit specifications, unit installation and 
configuration data, and unit operation data (such as schedules).  The tool is a software product that will be 
utilized primarily by building operators and facilities managers and only secondarily by HVAC service 
technicians, energy service providers, and operation supervisors.  Building operators will use the tool to 
monitor units for which they are responsible, perhaps monitoring from a central control room within the 
building.  Service technicians will utilize the product on site during repair and maintenance visits or off site 
between visits.  Energy service providers, responsible for a number of customers and facilities, will use the 
product to monitor a number of units remotely, possibly in many different buildings, checking for 
inefficiencies and problems requiring dispatch of service personnel.  Finally, building operator supervisors 
will use the tool to guide decisions on the assignment of operators and prioritization of work.  The tool will 
provide the user with a visual indication of faults, descriptive information concerning the faults and their 
causes, and suggested corrective actions.  The tool will store the results of diagnostics for subsequent 
retrieval and use.    
 
The software require ments described in this document are applicable to HVAC systems and associated 
subsystems.  Such subsystems can include chillers, cooling towers, and boilers.  However, the initial 
version of the tool will focus on diagnostics for chillers and cooling towers only.    The tool will automate 
diagnostic processes hitherto performed through a visual analysis of graphical data by a human expert. 
 
The “Product Overview” section describes factors that affect the software and its requirements. The 
“Concept Example” appendix describes how the software would function in an example situation.

Overall Description 
The following overview of the automated diagnostic tool supplies context for the specific requirements 
presented in later sections. The purpose of this information is to make the specific requirements easier to 
understand. All specific requirements are numbered in later sections. 
2.1 
Product Perspective 
Currently, diagnostics on HVAC units and subsystems are performed largely on a manual basis.  Sensed 
data, e.g., temperatures and pressures, are obtained from one or more data acquisition devices.  These 
devices measure and store sensed data over periods of several days to several weeks.  Prior to the 
diagnostic process, data from these devices is input to graphical display software for visual inspection by a 
human expert.  The expert, relying on technical expertise and results of previous diagnostic experience, 
evaluates the condition of the unit and subsystems based on visual plots of the data.  This process is 
depicted in Figure 1.

The process depicted in Figure 1 can be partitioned into three logical components.  These components are 
delineated in the diagram by dashed lines and are the data-preprocessing component, the diagnostic 
component, and output component.  The diagnostic tool described in this document will replace the current 
process with an automated one based on algorithms derived from expert practices.  These algorithms 
operate without the need for data visualization or human expert input.  Diagnostic results will be displayed 
to the user and stored for subsequent retrieval and analysis.  For the purposes of this document, the 
automated diagnostic tool will be assumed to preserve the logical construction of the current process.  This 
construction is depicted in Figure 2.

2.2 
Product Functions 
As previously stated, the functionality of the automated diagnostic tool can be partitioned into three logical 
components:  the data preprocessing component, the diagnostic component, and the output component.   
 
The data-preprocessing component obtains data describing the subsystem under diagnosis and reduces, 
filters, and otherwise prepares the data for input to the diagnostic component.  This data includes sensed 
data, e.g., temperatures, pressures, electrical current, machine state, etc., as well as fixed data describing the 
characteristics of the subsystem under diagnosis, for example, specifications and design information, 
operating characteristics and set points, etc.  The data may be processed through averaging, trending, or 
other statistical analysis.  Sensed data can originate from data acquisition hardware either in real time or at 
some arbitrary time after acquisition.  Fixed data will generally be compiled prior to operation of the 
diagnostic tool and be obtained from permanent storage when needed.  Specific requirements will be placed 
on the data-preprocessing component only with respect to types of data to be input and the format and 
interface requirements of this input.  However, the component is described here to provide insight into the 
operation of the software. 
 
The diagnostic component will detect and identify faults in the operation of HVAC subsystems based on 
sensed and fixed data input from the data-preprocessing component.  The diagnostic algorithms used for 
fault detection will be derived from current expert practices by AEC.  The faults identified by the

diagnostic will be enumerated and described under the functional requirements section. 
 
The output component will display and record results output from the diagnostic component.  The results of 
the diagnostics will be displayed to the user in a simple, graphical and textual format. The results will also 
be stored to permanent storage for subsequent retrieval and analysis. 
 
2.3 
User and Environment Characteristics 
As previously stated, users of the automated diagnostic tool will include service technicians, energy service 
providers, building operators, and building operator supervisors.  Installed platforms could include portable 
computers, handheld devices, and personal workstations in control rooms and offices.  Installed platforms 
may communicate with the HVAC unit under diagnosis using wireless interfaces, direct point-to-point 
connections, or over Internet or local area network.  Platform operating systems will be initially restricted 
to Microsoft Windows-compatible systems.   
 
The computer expertise of the user base could vary over a wide range.  Some users could be quite 
sophisticated, others familiar with only the most rudimentary computer-based tasks.  However, it is 
expected that all users will have a good fundamental understanding of HVAC units.  Setting up and 
operating the automated diagnostic tool should require minimal user input. 
 
Service technicians are expected to use the software as often as their service tasks dictate, perhaps several 
times a day for periods up to about one hour, in close proximity to the HVAC unit and possibly out of 
doors.   They may also set up the diagnostic tool to collect data continuously offsite at their offices and 
inspect the data periodically to identify faults or confirm proper operation.  Building operators are expected 
to use the software on an occasional basis every day.  The tool would collect data and process it 
continuously but the operators would only check the results periodically.  They may view results for only a 
few seconds to check the status of equipment while passing through a control room or may sit at a monitor 
for several minutes more carefully inspecting the diagnostic results and other information available on the 
tool’s display.  Energy service providers and building operator supervisors could potentially use the 
software in a more continuous mode, allowing it to operate undisturbed for many hours or days to record 
diagnostic results over a period of time. 
 
See the “Concept Example” appendix for a detailed example of how the automated diagnostic tool will be 
used. 
 
2.4 
General Constraints 
 
The automated diagnostic tool must support a wide variety of users with respect to computer expertise.  In 
addition, different users will have different expectations for the tool with respect to data presentation and 
functionality.  For instance, some users will simply require an immediate diagnostic result while other users 
may be interested in diagnostic results generated over an arbitrary time that can be subsequently reviewed. 
 
The tool must provide a capability to manually input and edit “fixed” data, i.e., data that does not vary in 
real-time.  Such data includes HVAC unit set points, specifications, and configuration information.  This 
data must be stored for subsequent use by the diagnostic tool for review and verification by other users and 
management.  The tool should provide for configuration management of fixed data.

The user must have the capability to configure the tool for continuous diagnostic analysis over an indefinite 
period of time.  In this mode, the tool will record diagnostic results for subsequent review.   No printed 
reports will be required of the tool, but the tool must print screen images of diagnostic results and historical 
data at user request and must provide long term storage of diagnostic results and permit the user to supply 
metadata relevant to the results, e.g., location, HVAC serial number, model number, user name, date, etc.   
 
The tool will not provide capability for additional user-defined analysis of the diagnostic results, results 
will be provided in a simple, final, definitive manner.  However, the tool may provide the user the 
capability to adjust the sensitivity of the diagnostic algorithms to increase the probability of exposing 
typically undetected diagnostic events or concealing detected diagnostic events (including false detections).   
 
The tool will be capable of obtaining sensed data from a variety of sources.  Such sources should include 
real-time data acquisition devices and data files containing previously acquired data.   
 
The current version of the tool will include diagnostic algorithms for cooling tower and chiller subsystems 
of HVAC units.  However, the design of the software should support the incorporation of diagnostic 
algorithms for additional HVAC subsystems.  In addition, the tool should support modification or 
replacement of existing diagnostic algorithms. 
 
The automated diagnostic tool will be restricted to Microsoft Windows-compatible operating systems. 
 
2.5 
Use-Case Model Survey 
This section provides an overview of the use case model that describes the operation of the user interface.  
Actual use cases that specifically define the operation of the user interface are presented in the 
requirements section. 
2.5.1 
Introduction 
The use case model consists of five use cases as depicted in Figure 3.  The main actor in the use case model 
is the human user.  This actor is generalized as “User”.  The User can be further specified as a general user 
or administrator.  The general user has no ability to modify system settings.  The admin istrator user is able 
to modify certain settings.  The use case “Start and Stop Diagnostics” describes the process by which the 
administrator user activates and ceases diagnostic processing.  The use case “Browse Current Diagnostics” 
describes the process by which the user views current diagnostic results.  The use case “Browse Historical 
Diagnostics” describes the process by which the user views historical diagnostic results.  The use case 
“Configure Diagnostics” describes the process by which the administrator user adjusts diagnostic 
parameters used in the diagnostic process.  The use case “Authenticate User” describes the process by 
which the user makes known to the tool the privileges to which they are entitled.

1. The user launches the tool by double-clicking the icon 
associated with the tool or typing the application’s name. 
2. The tool momentarily displays a splash screen 
identifying the tool, identifying developing and 
sponsoring organizations as appropriate, and listing 
copyright information. 
3. The tool displays the main window of the tool. 
4. The user starts the diagnostic processing by selecting a 
menu item named “Start Diagnostics” from a drop down 
menu named “Status”. 
5. Include (Authenticate User).  If the user has the 
appropriate privilege (i.e., the user is the administrator 
user) the tool requests a confirmatory response from the 
user to start the diagnostic processing. 
6. If the user confirms the desire to start diagnostic 
processing, the tool starts the processing and displays

3.2 
Functionality 
 
This section describes the functional requirements of the software, that is, requirements 
describing the core functions the software must perform.  This section begins with general 
requirements relevant to the tool as a whole.  Subsequently, requirements are organized by the 
logical construction of the tool as data processing progresses from preprocessing to output 
processing.  
 
3.2.1 
General 
The following general requirements pertain equally to the logical partitions of the tool. 
 
3.2.1.1 Users of the tool shall be classified into two types.  The first type, general user, shall only be 
permitted to utilize a limited set of the capabilities of the tool.  These capabilities are listed in Table 2.  
Typically a general user is only permitted to view the results of diagnostic processing either current or 
historical.  The second type, administrator, shall be permitted all the privileges of the general user plus 
those identified in Table 2.  The administrator is permitted all the privileges of the general user in addition 
to the privileges to configure the system and modify fixed data and diagnostic settings.

3.2.2 
Preprocessing 
The automated diagnostic tool shall input sensed data in real time from data acquisition devices 
and the HVAC unit under diagnosis as well as from data files containing previously acquired data, 
though not simultaneously.  In addition, the tool shall input fixed data provided by the user.  
Sensed and fixed data used by the tool in performing automated diagnostics shall be stored to 
permanent storage for post-analysis by the diagnostic process and viewing of the results.  
 
3.2.2.1 The tool shall input sensed data in real time from data acquisition devices and the HVAC unit 
under diagnosis.  The absolute time of input will be associated with each sensed data item for its 
complete lifecycle, including permanent storage.  The time will be determined at the instant the 
acquisition of the sensed data is complete.

Page 17  
 
3.2.2.2 The tool shall permit sensed data to be input from an electronic file, though not simultaneously 
with sensed data from external acquisition hardware.  When inputting sensed data from an electronic file, 
only one file shall be used containing all necessary sensed data.  The file shall be an ASCII text file 
containing only columns delimited by a single tab character or single comma.  The file shall begin with a 
required header.  The first column of the header will list, at a minimum, the entries “”Building Identifier” 
and “Input Identifier” in that order.  Following columns on the Input Identifier row will list integer input 
identifiers.  Following columns on the Building Identifier row will list corresponding integer building 
identifiers for the inputs.   One or more comment rows may exist above and below these required rows.  
These comment rows are identified by a ‘#’ as the first character of the first column.  These rows are 
ignored by the tool.  The first uncommented column in the file after the required headers shall list the 
absolute time, in ascending order, associated with all entries in subsequent columns of the row.  Each 
additional column in the file shall pertain to one and only one sensed parameter.  Data values in the same 
row of the file correspond to identical time values.  All columns in the file shall have the same number of 
rows.  An example input file is presented in Table 3.  When the tool is processing sensed data from an 
input file, the tool is considered to be operating in “batch mode”.

3.2.2.3 Each sensed data item will be qualified as to its certitude during the acquisition process.  Sensed 
data will be considered in doubt if acquisition of the data was not possible (for example, if an error occurs 
during communication with the acquisition hardware), or the data is outside the range of possible values.  
Otherwise, the sensor value will be deemed accurately acquired.  
 
3.2.2.4 The software will deem sensed data in doubt if acquisition of the data is not possible, due to 
communication failures, for a default number of successive samples.  The default is dependent on sensor 
type.  These default values are specified in Table 4.  The number of successive samples for a given 
sensor type shall be modifiable by the administrator.  Data not successfully acquired will be deemed 
“missing data”.

The Sump temperature is 
above the cooling tower fan 
“on” set point, but all cooling 
tower fans are not on.  This 
indicates a problem with the 
fan staging and, as a result, 
the cooling tower is not 
maintaining the sump 
temperature as low as it 
should. 
Cooling Tower Fan Staging 
Cooling Tower Fan Staging Problem 
A fan is on even though the 
sump temperature is below 
the “off” set point.  This 
indicates a fan staging 
problem, and energy is being 
wasted.  All cooling tower 
fans should be off. 
 
Cooling Tower Range 
Cooling Tower Range Problem 
The cooling tower range is 
below its benchmark.  As 
result, heat rejection by the 
cooling tower is less than 
expected and the cooling 
tower is performing at less 
than its capacity.

Cooling Tower Fan Cycling 
Problem 
The cooling tower fan is 
not staying on long 
enough during cycling. 
1)  The timer that is 
supposed to 
eliminate short 
cycling is not 
working properly.  
2) The "on" and 
"off" control set 
points for the fan 
are too close to one 
another.  3) The 
cooling tower 
capacity is too great 
for the load, so the 
fans rapidly cycle 
off (i.e., the on time 
is very short) 
because the load is 
met quickly. 
 
Cooling Tower 
Sump Temperature is 
Improperly Controlled 
The cooling tower fan is 
off but should be on.  As 
a result, the condenser 
water is not being cooled 
sufficiently.   
1) a cooling tower 
control problem, 2) 
sump temperature 
sensor problem, 3) 
electrical problems 
such as a motor 
failure, 4) other 
problems with the 
fan motor.

The cooling tower fan is 
on but it should be off.  
Energy is being wasted. 
1) a cooling tower 
control problem, 2) 
an actuator or relay 
has failed. 
 
Cooling Tower Approach 
Problem 
The cooling tower 
approach is greater than 
the Approach 
Benchmark provided in 
set up.  Heat rejection 
from the cooling tower is 
less than expected. 
1) The cooling 
tower media is 
fouled due to 
mineral deposits or 
ambient dirt, dust, 
or other 
contaminants.    
2) Restricted 
airflow for other 
reasons (e.g., piece 
of cardboard stuck 
over part of cooling 
tower air inlet).  3) 
There is condenser 
pump fouling, pipe 
fouling, or other 
restrictions on the 
water side. 
 
The Sump temperature is 
above the cooling tower 
fan “on” set point, but all 
cooling tower fans are 
not on.  This indicates a 
problem with the fan 
staging and, as a result, 
the cooling tower is not 
maintaining the sump 
temperature as low as it 
should. 
1)  Different values 
of the fan “on” set 
point are  specified 
in the fan controller 
and this software.  
2) Fan staging 
control algorithm is 
not correctly 
specified.  3)  A fan 
motor or electrical 
connection has 
failed.  4)  The 
sump temperature 
sensor has failed or 
is out of calibration. 
 
Cooling Tower Fan Staging 
Problem 
A fan is on even though 
the sump temperature is 
below the “off” set 
point.  This indicates a 
fan staging problem, 
and energy is being 
wasted.  All cooling 
tower fans should be 
off. 
1)  Different values 
of the fan “off” set 
point are  specified 
in the fan controller 
and this software.  
2) Fan staging 
control algorithm is 
not correctly 
specified.  3)  The 
sump temperature 
sensor has failed or 
is out of calibration.

Cooling Tower Range 
Problem 
The cooling tower range 
is below its benchmark.  
As result, heat rejection 
by the cooling tower is 
less than expected and 
the cooling tower is 
performing at less than 
its capacity. 
1)  Tower media 
may be fouled due 
to mineral deposits 
or ambient dirt, 
dust, or other 
contaminants.   
2)  the airflow is 
restricted by some 
other obstruction.  
3) The condenser 
pump is fouling, 
pipes are fouling, or 
there are other 
water-side flow 
restrictions.  4)  The 
cooling tower is too 
small for the load 
(i.e., there is a 
design problem) 
 
The is possibly a 
problem with the supply 
fan control.   
The chilled water 
pump is off and the 
supply fan for at 
least one air handler 
served by this pump 
is on.  There may be 
a problem with the

a.  
3.5.1.14 
The configuration window shall have a button labeled “Save” that when clicked will 
present the user with a window by which to enter a disk file or database name in which to save the 
modifiable data in the window.  Entering a file name shall cause the permanent storage of the modified 
parameters and their immediate use by the diagnostic operations after confirmatory responses by the 
user.  If the user does not confirm the request to save, it will not be performed.  If the user does not 
confirm the request to relay the modified parameters to the diagnostic processing immediately, it will not 
be performed.  In either event, the configuration window will remain displayed.  
3.5.1.15 
The configuration window shall have a button labeled “Close” that will dismiss the 
configuration window and return the user to the main window.  If the user has made changes to data in 
the configuration window, the tool will request confirmation of the user’s desire to dismiss the window.  If 
the user does not confirm the request, the window will not be dismissed.  
3.5.1.16 
The configuration window shall have a button labeled “Recall” that will permit the user to 
recall a disk file of previously saved parameters from which to populate the configuration window.  When 
functioning as a screen saver, the window shall change location on the screen periodically and will 
continue to be updated by diagnostic results.  
3.5.1.17 
The subsystems window shall list subsystems monitored for a specific building and 
summarizing the current diagnostic status of all monitored subsystems.  A recommended layout for this 
window is presented in Figure 6.

Chilled Water Supply Temperature:
Possible Problem:  The chilled water supply temperature is too high.
Causes:  1) Chilled water supply temperature set point is set too high. 2)
Chiller 1 load exceeds capacity.
Fix:  1) Adjust chilled water supply set point appropriately. 2) Estimate
load from the temperature difference between chilled water supply
temperature and chilled water return temperature and the chilled water
loop flow rate.

Security 
Certain functions of the tool directly available to the user require the user to possess supplementary 
privileges associated with performing these functions.  These supplementary privileges are possessed by 
the administrator user and are in addition to those of the general user as described in 2.5.  The tool 
determines the type of user by requesting an identifier and password from the user.  The requirements 
related to this process are discussed in other requirements in this document.  
3.7 
Other Requirements 
 
The tool shall log to permanent storage the occurrence of changes to the fixed data.  The log shall indicate 
the time and date of the change, original value of the item(s) changed, and the new value of the item(s) 
changed.

1.1.1  Evaluate Compressor Power
vs. Time
Compare the current time to the scheduled time for the chiller to be on.,
If the current time is a scheduled chiller "on" time, then stop--make no further check.  OK.
If the current time is outside the scheduled chiller "on" times (i.e., the chiller should be off),
then check if the Compressor Status = "Off."
If the Compressor Status = "Off," then the chiller is off as it should be and it is OK.
Set Chiller Schedule OK/Not = "OK".
If the Compressor Status = "On," then the Chiller is "On" when it should be off.  Not
OK.  Energy is being wasted.  Set Chiller Schedule OK/Not = "Not OK"
Note:  The purpose of this process is to determine if the chiller is on when it is supposed to be off.

Calculate the upper bound for acceptable Chilled Water Temperature using
CHWST Upper Bound = CHW Setpoint + (CHWdUp)
Calculate the acceptable lower bound for the Chilled Water Temperature using
CHWST Lower Bound = CHW Setpoint - (CHWdDown).
Compare the Chilled Water Supply Temperature (CHWST) for steady state to the CHWST Upper Bound and
CHWST Lower Bound.
If CHWST Steady State CHW > CHWST Upper Bound, then
set CHWST Maintained OK/not = "Too high" for the current time.
If CHWST Steady State CHW <= CHWST Upper Bound
and CHWST Steady State CHW>= CHW Lower Bound,
then
set CHWST Maintained OK/not = "OK" for the current time.
If CHWST Steady State CHW < CHWST Lower Bound, then
set CHWST Maintained OK/not = "Too low" for the current time.
Calculate the CHW Temperature Deviation for a single point (current time)
CHWST Deviation = CHWST Steady State CHW - CHW Setpoint.

Update all values in the array, adding the current value of CHWST Maintained OK/not to the
array and by dropping the oldest value of CHWST Maintained OK/not from the array.
Update values for CHWSTNumber High and CHWSTNumber Low.
Set CHWSTNumber High = number of values "Too High" appearing in CHWST Maintained OK/not

Notes:  Conclusions regarding a fault existing or not based on individual points are likely to be
unrealiable.  Conclusions are likely to best be made by considering a high percentage of points over
some period of time exceeding some minimum time, e.g., a day or a week (24  hours or 168 hours).
Therefore, we base the assignment of CHWST Alarm on a minimum set of points rather than individual
points.

1.2.2.3  Determine CHWST Statistics*
If CHWSTAlarm = Too High, then
Calculate mean CHWST for the times correspoding to the too-high points in the CHWST
Maintained OK/not Array.
CHWST Mean Too-High Deviation = Sum [CHWST Deviation(time index)]/
(CHWSTNumber High),
where time index takes values between the currrent time and (CHWST Alarm Evaluation 
Interval - 1) time steps ago and the sum only includes values of CHWST Deviation
for which CHWST Maintained OK/not = "Too High".
Set Mean Too Low CHWST Deviation = null.
If CHWSTAlarm = Too Low, then
Calculate mean CHWST for the times correspoding to the too-low points in the CHWST
Maintained OK/not Array.
CHWST Mean Too-Low Deviation =
Sum [CHWST Deviation(time index)]/
(CHWSTNumber Low),
where time index takes values between the currrent time and (CHWST Alarm Evaluation 
Interval - 1) time steps ago and the sum only includes values of CHWST Deviation for
which CHWST Maintained OK/not = "Too Low".
Set Mean Too High CHWST Deviation = null.
Note:  This process is proposed for Round 2.  Also, additional or other statistics could be calculated in
this process.  These should also be proposed for Round 2.

1.3.1  Evaluate Compressor current (or power) vs time
If Compressor Status = "On" and  Last Compressor Status = "On",   then terminate this evaluation.  Nothing new to
check.
If Compressor Status = "On" and Last Compressor Status = "Off," then set Last Compressor Switch On Time = Current
Time and check Last Compressor Off Interval.
Calculate the Last Compressor Off Interval using
Last Compressor Off Interval = Last Compressor Switch On Time - Last Compressor Switch Off Time
If Last Compressor Off Interval  >= Minimum Compressor Off Time, then set Compressor Off Cycle OK/not = 
"OK."
If Last Compressor Off Interval  <  Minimum Compressor Off Time, then set Compressor Off Cycle OK/not =
"not OK." The compressor is not staying off long enough during cycling.  Possible causes include an
incorrectly specified minimum off time in the control algorithm or for compressors with minimum on/off times
controlled by a relay a failed relay or one requiring adjustment.
If Compressor Status = "Off" and Last Compressor Status = "Off," then terminate this evaluation.  Nothing new to check.
If Compressor Status = "Off" and  Last Compressor Status =  "On",  then set Last Compressor Switch Off Time = Current
Time and check Last Compressor On Interval.
Calculate the Last Compressor On Interval using
Last Compressor On Interval = Last Compressor Switch Off Time - Last Compressor Switch On Time
If Last Compressor On Interval >= Minimum Compressor On Time, then Compressor On Cycle OK/not =
"OK."
If Last Compressor On Interval  <  Minimum Compressor On Time, then Compressor On Cycle OK/not =
"not OK." The compressor is not staying on long enough during cycling.  Possible causes include an
incorrectly specified minimum on time in the control algorithm or for compressors with minimum on/off times 
controlled by a relay a failed relay or one requiring adjustment.
Update Last Compressor Status : Set Last Compressor Status = Compressor Status*
*This over-writes previous compressor status with current status and should not be performed if previous status is
required in subsequent processing.

result in damage to the compressor.
If the Compressor Status = "Off" and the Condenser-Pumps Status = "On," then further evaluation is

.
If Current Time - Condenser Pumps Last Time Turned On <= Condenser Pumps Max Start-

this corresponds to no fault detected).
If Current Time - Condenser Pumps Last Time Turned On > CondenserPumps Max Start-Up

pumps are turning on too much in advance of the chiller and wasting energy.

2.1.1 Evaluate CT Fans Status vs.
Condenser Pumps Status
Compare the CT Fans Status and Condenser Pumps Status for the current time.
If the CT Fans Status = "On" and the Condenser Pumps Status = "On," then CT Fans/Condenser
Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "OK"
If the CT Fans Status = "Off" and the Condenser Pumps Status = "Off," then CT Fans/Condenser
Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "OK."
If the CT Fans Status = "On" and the Condenser Pumps Status = "Off,"  then CT Fans/Condenser
Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "Not OK."  The CT Fans must be off when the condenser pumps are off,
otherwise energy is being wasted.
If the CT Fans Status = "Off" and the Condenser Pumps Status = "On," then CT Fans/Condenser
Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "OK." The cooling tower Fans may be off when  the  condenser pumps are
running, but this should not always be the case.
Note:  This process uses as inputs the CT Fans Status and the Condenser Pumps Status that are determined in
Process 7.0.
Values of CT Fans/Condenser Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "OK" should be interpretted more precisely as "no
problem has been detected with this interlock."  It is possible that no problem is detected under current
conditions,yet an interlock problem exists.  This is particularly true when CT Fans Status = "Off" and Condenser
Pumps Status = "On,"  which while OK under some condtions is not always OK.  Additional diagnostics would be
useful here.

If CT Fans Status = "On" and Last CT Fans Status = "On,"  then terminate this evaluation.  There is nothing new to check.

If Last CT Fans Off Interval  <  Minimum CT Fans Off Time, then CT Cycling OK/Not =  "Not OK." The CT fans are not staying off 
long enough during cycling.
Possible causes include::
The timer that is supposed to eliminate short cycling is not working properly.
The "on" and "off" control setpoints for the fans are too close to one another.
Possible corrective actions include:
Check the control algorithm for the fans if it is controlled by software.  Increase the minimum off time in the
software, as necessary, to meet the manufacturers specification for minimum off time.
Check the performance of the time-delay relay.  Energize the relay and manually time the delay until action.
Compare the measured time with the specification.  Replace or adjust the relay if it is out of spec.

If Last CT Fans On Interval  <  Minimum CT Fans On Time, then CT Cycling OK/Not =  "Not OK." The CT fans are not staying on 
long enough during cycling.
Possible causes include:
The timer that is supposed to eliminate short cycling is not working properly.
The "on" and "off" control setpoints for the fans are too close to one another.
The cooling tower capacity is too great for the load, so the fans rapidly cycle off (i.e., the on time is very short)
because the load is met quickly.
Possible corrective actions include:
Check the control algorithm for the fans if it is controlled by software.  Increase the minimum off time in the
software, as necessary, to meet the manufacturers specification for minimum off time.
Check the performance of the time-delay relay.  Energize the relay and manually time the delay until action.

2.2.3.1.2.2  Check Approach
Compare values of CT Approach to the CT Approach Benchmark.
If CT Approach is <= CT Approach Benchmark,  then set CT Approach OK/Not = "OK"
If CT Approach is > CT Approach Benchmark, then there is a problem (not OK) with CT heat rejection.  Set CT 
Approach OK/Not = "Not OK.  There is a problem with heat rejection from the cooling tower."
Possible causes of heat rejection degradation (i.e., CT Approach OK/Not = Not OK):
Cooling tower media fouled due to mineral deposits or ambient dirt/dust/etc.  Need to inpsect.
Restricted airflow for other reasons (e.g., piece of cardboard stuck over part of cooling tower air 
inlet)
Condenser pump fouling, pipe fouling, or other restrictions on the water side.

should be off."
Note:
The minimum and maximum sump temp setpoints are currently specified as inputs.  A procedure could be developed
to derive them from performance data.  This would reduce the  number of user inputs required.
Note: A process for checking the individual fan stages has not been specified here.  it would need to be added.  See

Restricted airflow
Condenser pump fouling, again, pipe fouling, restrictions

3.1.1  Set Compressor "On" Threshold
Calculate the Compressor "On" Threshold using
Compressor "On" Threshold = Compressor P x Compressor Motor Rated Current (or Power)
Notes:
The chiller is "on" when the compressor is "on;"  therefore, the chiller status can be determined by
evaluating the compressor on/off status.  As the result, the Chiller "On" Threshold is set by setting the
Compressor "On" threshold.
The Compressor "On" Threshold is calculated from input power rating of the compressor motor.
Compressor P has values that range from 10 to 50% --  this can be a user input.

3.1.2  Assess Compressor Status and State
For each  value of Compressor Current (or Power),
compare Compressor Current (or Power) to the Compressor "On" Threshold.
If the value of Compressor Current (or Power) <= Compressor "On" Threshold, then set Compressor 
Status = "Off" and set Compressor State = "Off"
If the value of Compressor Current (or Power) > Compressor "On" Threshold, then set Compressor 
Status = "on."
If Compressor Status = "On", then evaluate Compressor State as follows:
Update the value of Last Compressor State,  using
Last Compressor State = Compressor State.
Determine and assign the new value of Compressor State for the current  time
Check if the compressor is already in steady state
If Last Compressor State = Steady,
then set Compressor State = "Steady"
If Compressor Status = "On" and the Last Compressor State = "Transient",  then
Calculate Drop in CHW Supply Temperature using
Drop in CHWST = CHWST Last - CHWST
Compare Drop in CHW Supply Temperature to the Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST.
If Drop in CHWST >  Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST, then set Compressor 
State =  "Transient".
If Drop in CHWST <= Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST, then set Compressor 
State =  "Steady"
Update CHWST Last
CHWST Last = CHWST
Note:  Compressor Status = Chiller Status

Calculate the Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST using the relation:
Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST = CHW Transient Decrease Factor * (CHWST at
   Last Time Off - CHWST Setpoint)
Set new value of CHWST at Last Time Off,
If Compressor Status = "Off" and  Last Compressor Status = "Off",  then
set CHWST at Last Time Off = CHWST
If Compressor Status = "On" and Last Compressor Status = "Off", then
set CHWST at Last Time Off = CHWST Last
If Compressor Status = "On" and Last Compressor Status = "On" then
set CHWST at Last Time Off = CHWST at Last Off Time (i.e., not change).
Update Last Compressor Status
            Last Compressor Status = Compressor Status*
*This over-writes the previous compressor status with the current status and should not be performed if
the previous status is required in subsequent processing.

Variable 
Definition 
Values 
CHWST Alarm 
A variable indicating the current value of the 
alarm for the chilled water supply temperature 
deviations from set point.  It takes values of 
“Too High”, “Too Low”, and “OK”.   It indicates 
whether the CHW temperature is maintained 
adequately over a designated minimum 
number of time steps  (CHWST Alarm Interval 
High and CHWST Alarm Interval Low). 
Too high, too low or Ok. 
CHWST Alarm 
Evaluation Interval  
The number of time steps immediately 
preceding the current time over which the 
criterion for a CHWST alarm is evaluated.  This 
parameter takes integer values and is 
adjustable to change the low-alarm sensitivity.  
Its value may be specified as a set-up variable, 
default value, or empirically adjustable. 
Number of time steps. 
CHWST Alarm 
Trigger High 
The minimum fraction of values of the variable 
CHWST Maintained OK/not that are equal to 
"Too High", when evaluated over CHWST 
Alarm Evaluation Interval time steps, for a high 
alarm to be reported, i.e., for CHWST Alarm to 
be set equal to “CHWST High.”   This variable 
takes values between 0.51 and 1.0 (i.e., 51% 
and 100%).  It may be a user set-up input, a 
default value, or a empirically adjusted 
sensitivity.  The current process descriptions 
assume that High and Low alarms cannot 
occur simultaneously. 
Real values between 0.51 
and 1.00. 
CHWST Alarm 
Trigger Low 
The minimum fraction of values of the variable 
CHWST Maintained OK/not that are equal to 
"Too Low", when evaluated over CHWST 
Alarm Evaluation Interval time steps for an 
alarm to be reported, i.e., for CHWST Alarm to 
be set equal to “CHWST Low.”   This variable 
takes values between 0.51 and 1.0 (i.e., 51% 
and 100%).  It may be a user set-up input, a 
default value, or a empirically adjusted 
sensitivity. 
Real values between 0.51

Set HW_Pump_Last_Status = HW_Pump_Status
For each value of HW_Pump_Current, check if the HW_Pump_On_Threshold is exceeded, and set the
hot-water pump status accordingly.
If the value of HW_Pump_Current <= HW_Pump_On_Threshold, then
set HW_Pump_Status =  "Off"
If the value of HW_Pump_Current  > HW_Pump_On_Threshold, then
