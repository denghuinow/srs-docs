Executive Summary 
This document describes a detailed approach to porting low-level Open Watcom GUI library to Linux 
platform using GTK toolkit for the X Window System.  
 
1. Introduction 
1.1 About this document 
This paper represents a result of the Open Watcom low level GUI library research. It provides porting 
guidelines and identifies the effort required to port the GUI library to Linux platform using GTK 
windowing toolkit for the X Window System. The research was based on the Open Watcom version 1.1.7 
This paper is intended as a base Software Requirements Specification for the Open Watcom GUI porting 
project. 
1.2 Document structure 
This document consists of several parts. 
 “GTK Overview” provides a short overview of the GIMP Toolkit 
“General GUI Porting Approach” describes a porting approach. 
“Issues” identifies a set of possible caveats that should be considered before commencing the porting effort. 
“Target System Requirements” provides information about required software on a target system for the 
ported library to run. 
 “Detailed Porting Guidelines and Estimation” provides detailed guidelines on porting each library 
function.

2. GTK Overview 
GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a library for creating graphical user interfaces. It is licensed using the LGPL 
license, so open software, free software, or commercial non-free software can be developed using GTK 
without having to spend costs on licenses or royalties. 
It's called the GIMP toolkit because it was originally written for developing the GNU Image Manipulation 
Program (GIMP), but GTK has now been used in a large number of software projects, including the GNU 
Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) project. GTK is built on top of GDK (GIMP Drawing Kit) 
which is basically a wrapper around the low-level functions for accessing the underlying windowing 
functions (Xlib in the case of the X windows system), and gdk-pixbuf, a library for client-side image 
manipulation. 
GTK is essentially an object oriented application ’programmers interface (API). Although written 
completely in C, it is implemented using the idea of classes and callback functions (pointers to functions). 
There is also a third component called GLib which contains a few replacements for some standard calls, as 
well as some additional functions for handling linked lists, etc. The replacement functions are used to 
increase GTK's portability, as some of the functions implemented here are not available or are non-standard 
on other Unixes (one example being g_strerror)(). Some also contain enhancements to the libc versions, 
such as g_malloc() that has enhanced debugging utilities. 
In version 2.0, GLib has picked up the type system which forms the foundation for GTK's class hierarchy, 
the signal system which is used throughout GTK, a thread API which abstracts the different native thread 
APIs of the various platforms and a facility for loading modules. 
As the last component, GTK uses the Pango library for internationalized text output. 
Why use GTK? 
It is: 
• 
Stable, 
• 
Free, 
• 
Fast, 
• 
Well documented, 
• 
Broadly adopted, 
• 
Themes support, 
• 
Extensible. 
 
3. General GUI Porting Approach 
The Watcom GUI library depends on the Watcom Programming Interface (WPI) and Memory Tracker 
(TrMem) libraries. WPI is explicitly designed to port Windows functionality to OS/2 Presentation Manager 
(not the other way around). Both Windows and OS/2 APIs have similar and compatible designs to a large 
extent. GTK API is similar neither to Windows nor to OS/2 API, so it would be ineffective to extend the 
WPI library with GTK support. However taking into account that the Watcom GUI library actively uses 
WPI calls it seems reasonable to port most of the WPI functions called in the library. 
Since the GUI library relies on OS/2 PM and Windows API, it uses predefined types that exist only in these 
environments, such as HWND and HBRUSH. It will be an additional work for the programmer to add 
appropriate type definitions in a special file. For instance, HWND should be defined as GtkWidget*, and 
HBRUSH should be defined as GdkStyle*.

As long as in Windows and OS/2 environments user interface controls are placed according to the specified 
coordinates we must replicate this in GTK using the following widget hierarchy:   
Window – Vertical Box – Scrolled Window – View Port – Fixed

4. Issues 
Due to the fact that Open Watcom itself is heavy oriented towards Windows, several issues should be 
considered and dealt with before commencing the porting effort.  
• 
Resource files 
There is no possibility in GTK to handle the Windows or OS/2 – style resource files. GTK uses its own 
resource files which are very much different from those in Windows or OS/2 and allows to specify only 
styles and key bindings of the widgets. There is a possibility to overcome this issue to some extent by using 
libglade library which is used in GTK to build user interface described in the XML file. A utility can be 
written to extract all the necessary information from the Windows – OS/2 resource files and present it in 
the XML format which can be handled by libglade to build a user interface. However this will provide 
only a partial solution as there is nothing like String Table in libglade as string resources are 
handled by gettext library in GTK. Also there are no numeric resource identifiers in GTK. Problematic 
functions are: GUICreateResDialog(), GUICreateDialogFromRes() and 
GUILoadString().  
• 
MDI "Windows in Window" model 
GTK has no possibility to implement applications with MDI "Windows in Window" model. However, it is 
possible to assign a parent for windows, and they will be destroyed when the parent is closed.  
• 
Help subsystem 
GTK has no built in user help subsystem, as this level of user interaction is handled by desktop 
environments. Problematic functions here are: GUIHelpInit(), GUIHelpFini(), 
GUIShowHelp(), GUIDisplayHelp(), GUIDisplayHelpWin4() and 
GUIDisplayHelpId().  
Other issues to consider include: 
• 
Numeric identifiers of widgets.  
• 
Specific approach to window building includes Window Classes and Dialog Templates.  
• 
The toolkit allows modifying window (system) menu, which is impossible in GTK.

5. Target System Requirements 
GTK is broadly adopted among the major Linux distribution vendors including RedHat, SuSE, 
TurboLinux. So, in general case deployment of the ported library should not be a problem. In case the 
target distribution does not support GTK at all or uses incompatible or older versions of the toolkit the 
library can be linked statically, the drawback of this approach will be an increased size of the library. 
In situations when the library would be shipped in source files and then compiled, target system will have 
to satisfy to a number of requirements. Namely it must have a C compiler and an X Window System 
including the following libraries:  
• 
pkg-config (only for compilation) 
• 
GNU make (only for compilation) 
• 
JPEG, PNG and TIFF image libraries 
• 
FreeType 
• 
fontconfig 
• 
GNU libiconv library 
• 
GNU gettext 
• 
GLib 
• 
Pango 
• 
ATK 
•

Detailed Porting Guidelines and Estimation 
Initial Stage 
6. GUI Library Initialization. 
GUI library initialization procedure starts from GUIXMain() function called from predefined in the 
library main().  
Below is the list of subsequent function calls originated from GUIXMain().  
 
GUIXMain() 
  GUIStoreArgs() 
    GUISetWindowClassName() 
      GUIGetWindowClassName() 
  _wpi_setwpiinst() 
  GUIMemOpen() 
  GUIFirstCrack() 
  SetupClass() 
  GUILoadStrInit() 
    GUIGetExtName() 
  GUIInitInternalStringTable() 
  GUIInitGUIMenuHint() 
  GUIGetFront() 
  GUIWinMessageLoop() 
  GUICleanup() 
    GUIDeath() 
    GUICleanupHotSpots() 
    GUIFreeStatus() 
    GUIFiniInternalStringTable() 
    GUILoadStrFini() 
    GUISysFini() 
    GUIFiniDialog() 
      GUIFree() 
  GUIDead() 
  GUIMemClose() 
 
Majority of these functions does not need to be changed, GUISetWindowClassName() and 
GUIGetWindowClassName() is not needed for GTK port at all, since GTK has no window classes.  
 
The following functions should be ported: 
GUIXMain() –  0.5 hour(s)  
SetupClass() - 0.5 hour(s) 
_wpi_postquitmessage() –  0.5 hour(s) 
GUILoadStrInit() –  0.5 hour(s) 
GUIWinMessageLoop() –  1 hour(s) 
GUIXMain 
The only function called form the main(). It initializes program GUI, processes message queue and 
finishes the program.  
SciTech Software, Inc. 
 


Open Watcom Linux Port 
Page 15 of 54 
GUI Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.  
SetupClass 
Registers a window class.  
There are no window classes in GTK, so this function should be empty for the GTK port.  
Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.  
_wpi_postquitmessage 
Post QUIT message into the program.  
This function should be empty in GTK port since there is no need to emit QUIT message if message loop is 
not started.  
Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.  
GUILoadStrInit 
Load external resource DLL under Windows, and set GUIMsgInitFlag.  
Since there is no "external resource DLLs" in Linux, the GTK port should do the same that OS/2 port does, 
namely, just set GUIMsgInitFlag.  
Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.  
GUIWinMessageLoop 
Starts the main program loop.  
In GTK program message loop strats with gtk_main().  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour.  
Summary 
3 hours are needed for porting and, additionally, approximately 3 more hours are needed for testing and 
tuning, totaling to 6 hours for this part. 
At the completion of this step we will be able to execute the following code.  
int 
GUImain() {}

GUI Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
7. Display window initialization 
In order to initialize the library, programmer should call GUIWndInit() function.  
Below is the list of subsequent function calls originated from GUIWndInit(). 
 
GUIWndInit() 
  GUISysInit() 
  _wpi_setdoubleclicktime() 
  GUISetScreen() 
  GUIInitDialog() 
    GUIStrDup() 
      GUIAlloc() 
    DialogTemplate() 
    DoneAddingControls() 
    DynamicDialogBox() 
    GUIInitDialogFunc() 
      _wpi_enddialog() 
The following functions should be ported:  
GUIWndInit()– 1 hour(s) 
_wpi_setdouibleclicktime() – 0.5 hour(s) 
GUIInitDialogFunc() – 4 hour(s) 
_wpi_enddialog() – 1 hour(s) 
GUIWndInit 
High level function for the library initialization.  
It is needed to use gdk_screen_get_width() and gdk_screen_get_height() applied to the 
result of gdk_screen_get_default()in order to retrieve screen width and high, instead of 
_wpi_get_systemmetric().  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour(s).  
_wpi_setdouibleclicktime 
Sets the double click time.  
Programmer should use gdk_set_double_click_time()  
Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour(s).  
GUIInitDialogFunc 
Callback function the test dialog box used to get the dialog box font and client size information.  
In GTK it is possible to get the dialog box font from the style returned by 
gtk_widget_get_default_style().  
Instead of _wpi_getclientrect(), _wpi_getwidthrect() and _wpi_getheightrect() 
functions the gtk_widget_get_request_size() should be called.  
Time needed for porting: 4 hour(s).  
_wpi_enddialog 
This function is used to dismiss a dialog. Note, that this does not destroy the dialog by default but only 
hides the dialog.  
SciTech Software, Inc. 
 


Open Watcom Linux Port 
Page 17 of 54 
GUI Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
The similar behaviour could be achieved in GTK by emitting "delete_event" to the given window. 
g_signal_emit() or g_signal_emit_by_name() should be used.  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour(s).  
Summary 
6.5 hours are needed for porting activity and, additionally, approximately 3.5 hours are needed for testing 
and tuning. This step requires 10 hours. At the end of this step we will be able to execute the following 
code.  
 
int 
GUImain() { 
    GUIWndInit(250); 
} 
8. Window creation 
This step requires Resource Files handling implemented (see “Issues” section). 
Below is the list of subsequent function calls originated from GUICreateWindow(). 
GUICreateWindow() 
  GUISetupWnd() 
    GUIXSetupWnd() 
  GUIXCreateWindow() 
    GUISetupStruct() 
      GUICalcLocation() 
        GUIScaleToScreen() 
          GUIConvertRect() 
            GUIConvert() 
              GUIMulDiv() 
        GUIScaleToScreenR() 
          GUIConvertRect() 
            GUIConvert() 
              GUIMulDiv() 
        _wpi_getclientrect() 
        _wpi_getheightrect() 
        _wpi_cvtc_y_size_plus1() 
          _wpi_cvtc_y() 
            _wpi_getclientrect() 
            _wpi_getheightrect() 
      GUISetColours()

  GUIFreeWindowMemory() 
It is impossible to implement _wpi_loadmenu() and GUICreateMenus() on GTK because GTK doesn't 
support OS/2-like resource files and has no possibility to modify window (system) menu.  
Refer to the “Issues” section. 
The following functions should be ported: 
GUIXCreateWindow() – 4 hour(s) 
GUICalcLocation() – 2 hour(s) 
_wpi_createsolidbrush() – 2 hour(s) 
_wpi_create_window_ex() – 4 hour(s) 
_wpi_setredraw() – 1 hour(s) 
GUIMaximizeWindow() – 1 hour(s) 
GUIMinimizeWindow() – 1 hour(s) 
_wpi_showwindow() – 1 hour(s) 
GUIShowWindowNA() – 1 hour(s) 
GUIFreeWindowMemory() – 2 hour(s) 
GUIXCreateWindow 
This high level function creates a window widget and applies the passed parameters to it.  
Despite the fact that all the low-level functionality is performed by sub-calls, some tweaking may be 
needed.  
Time needed for porting: 4 hours.  
GUICalcLocation 
This function calculates coordinates of the new window. Note that X Window System window managers 
are free to ignore this; most window managers ignore requests for initial window placement (using a user-
defined placement algorithm instead) and honors requests only after the window has been shown.  
Instead of using _wpi_getclientrect() to get client area coordinates of the window, programmers 
should use gtk_widget_get_request_size().  
Time needed for porting: 2 hours.

_wpi_createsolidbrush 
In Windows this returns a solid brush with color. In OS/2 PM this allocates space for the object structure 
and sets the foreground colour for the brush.  
For GTK this should create GtkStyle structure with the given parameters.  
Time needed for porting: 2 hours.  
_wpi_create_window_ex 
This function returns pointer to newly created window widget with the given parameters.  
When ported, this function should make a call of gtk_window_new(), and apply parameters passed in 
info. After the window is created, it is necessary to put GtkScrolledWindow widget in it and then put 
GtkFixed widget in the scrolled window widget.  See “General Porting Approach” section. 
Time needed for porting: 4 hours.  
_wpi_setredraw 
This function enables/disables window updates.  
Should be done via gdk_window_thaw_updates() and gdk_window_freeze_updates()  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour.  
GUIMaximizeWindow 
This function maximizes the specified window.  
In order to ask the window manager to maximize the window in GTK gtk_window_maximize() 
should be called.  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour.  
GUIMinimizeWindow 
This function minimizes the specified window.  
In order to ask window manager to minimize the window in GTK, gtk_window_minimize() should 
be called.  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour.  
_wpi_showwindow 
Shows the window according to the given state. Windows predefined states are used.  
In the GTK gtk_widget_show() and gtk_window_hide()  should be used. 
Time needed for porting: 1 hour.  
GUIShowWindowNA 
Shows the window.  
 gdk_window_show() should be used 
Time needed for porting: 1 hour. 
GUIFreeWindowMemory 
Frees all resources related to the given window.  
In GTK gtk_object_destory() should be called which automatically will destroy all children. Some 
additional tweaking may be needed.

Time needed for porting: 2 hours.  
Summary 
19 hours are needed for porting activity and, additionally, approximately 16 more hours are needed for 
testing and tuning. This step requires 35 hours. At the finish of this step we will be able to execute the 
following code.  
 
#include "gui.h"

Creates a dialog with specified controls.  
Instead of calling GlobalFree() here the window should be destroyed with 
gtk_widget_destroy() Some tweaking may be needed.  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour.  
SciTech Software, Inc. 
 


Open Watcom Linux Port 
Page 28 of 54 
GUI Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
GUIDoCreateResDialog 
Creates dialog defined in resource file.  
Consider Issues section. 
DialogTemplate 
Creates a dialog template.  
There are no dialog templates in GTK. However, Open Watcom GUI Library adds controls to dialog 
templates, so we will create a dialog in this function. gtk_window_create() is needed to create a 
dialog. 
Time needed for porting: 2 hours.  
AddControl 
Adds control to the specified dialog template.  
There is big amount of work here. This function should create all necessary controls, and apply specified 
attributes for every requested control.  
Depending on type of the control and attributes various GTK functions should be used. 
Time needed for porting: 8 hours.  
DoneAddingControls 
Called when there are no more controls.  
Should be empty in GTK port.  
Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour.  
DynamicDialogBox 
Creates a dynamic dialog box.  
Should do nothing in GTK port, since DialogTemplate() function created the dialog.  
Time needed for porting: 0.5 hour.  
GUIDialogFunc 
Callback function for all dynamically created dialogs.  
Should be rewritten for GTK version. The callback should correctly process resizing "resize-
request" and "close" events.  
Time needed for porting: 2 hours.  
GUIDestroyWnd 
Destroys the given window or all windows if NULL.  
In GTK port, the function should call gtk_widget_destroy() for the given window or for the top-
level window if NULL.  
Time needed for porting: 2 hours 
GUIGetText 
Returns a copy of the text.  
SciTech Software, Inc. 
 


Open Watcom Linux Port 
Page 29 of 54 
GUI Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
Should be greatly modified in GTK port, but it is a  straightforward task. Text of almost all widgets could 
be retrieved via gtk_label_get_label(), and gtk_button_get_label(). Note that returned 
string will be owned by a widget and must not be modified or freed. So, it is needed to duplicate them in 
this function.  
Selection of GtkTreeView could be accessed via gtk_tree_view_get_selection() function.  
Time needed for porting: 6 hours.  
GUISendMessage 
Sends a message to the specified window.  
g_signal_emit() should be used for this purpose.  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour.  
GUIWndDirty 
Tells the user interface that interface should be repainted.  
gdk_window_process_updates() can repaint the window in GTK.  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour.  
GUIGetMetrics 
Returns text metrics for font of the given window.  
GUIGetDC() and GUIReleaseDC should not be called in GTK port. There is no need to work on so 
low level in GTK. FontMetrics of the given window could be retrieved in the following way:  
 
PangoContext context = gtk_widget_get_pango_context(widget); 
 
PangoFontMetrics metrics = pango_context_get_metrics(context, 
widget->style->font_desk, pango_context_get_language(context)); 
 
g_memmove(&GUItm, metrics); 
 
pango_font_metrics_unref(metrics); 
Time needed for porting: 2 hours.  
GUIGetClientRect 
Returns scaled, depending upon current scaling settings, rectangle of the given window in absolute 
coordinates.  
Note, that client area of the window is the area of the GtkScrolledWindow widget placed in the 
window.  
Time needed for porting: 1 hour.  
_wpi_mapwindowpoints 
Translates coordinates relative to source widget's allocation to coordinates relative to destination widget's 
allocations.  
The similar functionality in GTK should be achieved by 
gtk_widget_translate_coordinates(). Note that there is no definition similar to 
HWND_DESKTOP in GTK. To get the needed value (root window of a given widget) 
gtk_widget_get_root_window() should be called for a given widget.  
Time needed for porting: 2 hours.

_wpi_getwrectvalues 
Returns coordinates of the rectangle.  
Should be rewritten using GdkRectangle type.  
Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.  
_wpi_getheightrect 
Returns height of the given rectangle.  
Should be rewritten using GdkRectangle structure.  
Time needed for porting: 0.5 hours.  
DrawRect 
Draws specified rectangle in the given window.  
Should be rewritten. GTK paint functions applied to the GtkFixed widget placed in the window should 
be used for this purpose. This approach will allow avoiding all the sub-calls.  
Time needed for porting: 4 hours.  
GUIXDrawText 
Draws specified text in the given window.  
Should be rewritten. pango_layout_set_text() should be used for text rendering, and 
gtk_paint_layout() applied to GtkFixed widget placed in the window should be used for 
drawing. This approach will allow avoiding all the sub-calls.  
Time needed for porting: 6 hours.  
Summary 
41 hours are needed for porting activity and approximately 24 more hours are required for testing and 
tuning. This step requires 65 hours.  
Elaboration stage
