1.1 
This document defines the functional requirements for ERTMS/ETCS 
(EUROPEAN RAIL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM / EUROPEAN 
TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEM). The document primarily defines the 
operational requirements and therefore contains only a few technical 
terms. For consistency reasons, all functional requirements not 
implemented in the SRS 2.3.0 have been removed from this version.

In the requirements of this document: 
(M)   =  Mandatory:The requirement shall be respected in every 
ETCS application. The applicable requirements stated in 
ETCS SRS and lower level mandatory specifications shall 
be respected.        
(O)  = Optional:It is not mandatory to implement this function in 
every ETCS application. If implemented, the applicable 
requirements stated in ETCS SRS and lower level 
mandatory specifications shall be respected. Note that the 
CCS 
TSI 
may 
define 
specific 
conditions, 
where 
implementation of O functions may be required for safety 
reasons.

Glossary 
 
 
Describes terms used in the document. 
The title of a function is normally not 
described. Please refer to the note below for 
each function-title. 
 
 
The term: 
                   means: 
 
Absolute braking distance 
The distance between a train following another 
train shall be equal to or greater than the braking 
distance of the following train. 
 
Acknowledge, Acknowledgement New data/situation that the driver has to accept 
to avoid intervention.  
 
Advisory information 
Information indicated to the driver on the DMI to 
assist him in driving the train. 
 
Axle counter 
A method of “train detection”.  Track mounted 
equipment counts he number of axles entering and 
leaving a track section at each extremity. A 
calculation is performed to determine whether the 
track section is “occupied” or clear.

train, not coupled, supporting the train for moving 
up a hill, leaving the train on top whilst running. 
 
Block

trains by dividing the line into sections with, 
normally, no more than one train in each section. 
The block can either be a fixed block or a  moving 
block. 
 
Braking curve 
A speed-distance curve calculated from train and 
infrastructure data and deceleration parameters of 
the train. 
 
Confirm, Confirmation

obstacle on the track that may violate his vehicle(s).
