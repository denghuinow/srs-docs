DigitalHome Requirements Specification 
1. 
Introduction 
This document specifies the requirements for the development of a “Smart 
House”, called DigitalHome (DH), by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of 
HomeOwner Inc. A “Smart House” is a home management system that allows 
home residents to easily manage their daily lives by providing for a lifestyle that 
brings together security, environmental and energy management (temperature, 
humidity and lighting), entertainment, and communications. The Smart House 
components consist of household devices (e.g., a heating and air conditioning 
unit, a security system, and small appliances and lighting units, etc.), sensors 
and controllers for the devices, communication links between the components, 
and a computer system, which will manage the components. 
 
The DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is based on the 
DigitalHome Customer Need Statement. It is made up of a list of the principal 
features of the system. This initial version of DigitalHome will be a limited 
prototype version, which will be used by HomeOwner management to make 
business decisions about the future commercial development of 
DigitalHomeOwner products and services. Hence, the SRS is not intended as a 
comprehensive or complete specification of DigitalHome requirements. There is 
a supplementary document that provides additional detail and information about 
the DigitalHome requirements: the Digital Home Use Case Model [HO2010]. 
These document were prepared by the DigitalHomeOwner Division, in 
consultation with the Marketing Division of HomeOwner Inc.

Overall description 
3.1 
Product Description and Scope 
The Digital Home system, for the purposes of this document, is a system that will 
allow a home user to manage devices that control the environment of a home. 
The user communicates through a personal web page on the DigitalHome web 
server or on a local home server. The DH web server communicates, through a 
home wireless gateway device, with the sensor and controller devices in the 
home.  
 
The product is based on the Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition 
[HLRD 2010] is intended as a prototype, which will allow business decisions to 
be made about future development of a commercial product. The scope of the 
project will be limited to the management of devices which control temperature, 
humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units, through the 
use of a web-ready device. The prototype DH software system will be situated in 
a simulated environment. There will be no actual physical home and all sensors 
and controllers will be simulated. 
 
3.2 
Users Description 
3.2.1 DigitalHome Users 
3.2.1.1 
The general user shall be able to use the DH system 
capabilities to monitor and control the environment in his/her 
home. 
3.2.1.2 
The general user is familiar with the layout of his/her home and 
the location of sensor and control devices (for temperature, for 
humidity, and for power to small appliances and lighting units). 
3.2.1.3 
Although the general user is not familiar with the technical 
features of the DH system, he/she is familiar with the use of a 
web interface and can perform simple web operations (logging 
in and logging out, browsing web pages, and submitting 
information and requests via a web interface).  
3.2.1.4 
A Master user will be designated, who shall be able to change 
the configuration of the system. For example, a Master User 
shall be able to add a user account or change the default 
parameter settings. He/she will have the same right as the DH 
Technician, described in section 3.2.2.4. 
3.2.2 DigitalHome Technician 


Digital Home Project, SRS 1.3 
Page 6 
 
3.2.2.1 
A DH Technician is responsible for setting up and maintaining 
the configuration of a DH system. 
3.2.2.2 
A DH Technician has experience with the type of hardware, 
software, and web services associated with a system like the 
DH system. 
3.2.2.3 
A DH Technician is specially trained by DigitalHomeOwner to be 
familiar with the functionality, architecture, and operation of the 
DH system product.  
3.2.2.4 
A DH Technician will have rights beyond the DH General User, 
capable of setting up and making changes in the configuration 
of the system (e.g.,setting system parameters and establishing 
user accounts), and starting and stopping operation of the DH 
System. 
3.3 
Development Constraints 
3.3.1 The “prototype” version of the DigitalHome System (as specified in this 
document) must be completed within twelve months of inception. 
3.3.2 The development team will consist of five engineers. The 
DigitalHomeOwner Director will provide management and 
communication support. 
3.3.3 The development team will use the development process specified by 
the Digital HomeOwner Inc. 
3.3.4 Where possible, the DigitalHome project will employ widely used, 
accepted, and available hardware and software technology and 
standards, both for product elements and for development tools. See 
section 3.4 for additional detail. 
3.3.5 Because of potential market competition for DigitalHome products, the 
cost of DigitalHome elements (sensors, controllers, server, tools, etc.), 
for this project should be minimized. As part of the final project report 
the development team will describe their efforts to minimize costs, 
including price comparisons between DH elements and 
comparable/competitive elements. 
3.3.6 The DH system will be tested in a simulated environment. There will be 
no actual physical home and all sensors and controllers will be 
simulated. However, the simulated environment will be realistic and 
adhere to the physical properties and constraints of an actual home 
and to real sensors and controllers. 
3.3.7 Major changes to this document (e.g., changes in requirements) must 
be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division. 
3.4 
Operational Environment
