GENERAL: The blue coloured text style “explanation text” contains
instructions when using the template. The user is free to either adapt the
font of the style to become “hidden” or to remove all explanatory text when
the document is completed. For more information see the “template” pages on
the Intranet.
PREFACE: An FRS (Functional Requirements Specification) is a document
containing a complete description of a product’s external behaviour (that
is, with the entire interface between the product and its environment,
including other hardware, software, communication ports, and human users)
as a statement of what the system will do without defining how it works
internally.

The FRS contains two types of requirements: functional and non-functional.
The functional requirements define what the  system  does  with  a  complete
description of all the inputs and outputs to and from the system as well  as
information concerning how the inputs and outputs  interrelate  (chapter  0,
3, 4 and Error! Reference source not found.).
The non-functional requirements describe the quality and performance of  the
system (chapter Error! Reference source not found.).
The minimum outline that all FRS documents must use is:
1. Introduction
2. General Description
3. Functional Requirements
4. External Interface Requirements
5. User Interface Specification

Given the purpose of the FRS, it is clear that Design  Descriptions  do  not
belong in an FRS.

If the product to be defined is a software library, it probably is wiser to
use the content of the Software Component Specification (SCS) template
instead of the content of the FRS template. For more information, see Work
Instruction Architecture & Design.

Attributes of a well-written FRS.

A well-written requirement applies the following criteria:
                    • Clear & concise   It is written in clear, simple and
                      concise language. The primary readers of the document
                      are able to understand the description.
                    • Testable & measurable   A finite cost procedure exists
                      to test the requirement.
                    • Unambiguous It has only one interpretation.
                    • Necessary   It does not describe superfluous
                      information or explanation.
                    • Identifiable      It has a unique label or a number.
                    • Feasible    It is believed to be realisable.
                    • Design independent      It does not describe software
                      or hardware design decisions.

A well-written FRS contains a set of well-written requirements  and  applies
                      the following criteria:
                    • Complete    Everything the system is supposed to do is
                      in the document.
                    • Consistent  The requirements do not contradict.

How to organise an FRS

The chapters of  this  template  are  mandatory.  The  sections  within  the
chapters can  be  chosen  differently  depending  on  the  project  and  the
specific product.

For more information, read the Work Instruction Requirements Management.

Introduction


1 Purpose

The purpose of the  FRS  is  to  get  a  common  understanding  between  the
customer and  PDSL  on  the  product  requirements  of  the  Platform-i  MSN
application. The document serves as a basis for the Architectural Design  of
the Platform-i MSN application.

2 Scope

The  intended  audience  for  this  document  are  the  customer   and   the
development team.

3 Open points

Give a list of issues that have not been solved in this document  yet.  This
section should be empty when the document is accepted.
User Interface.

4 Requirements identification

Describe how the individual requirements will be  labelled  and/or  numbered
in   this   document.   Preferably   use   a   hierarchical   format,   e.g.
<label>.<label>.<number>.
The requirements will be in the format: <label><number>

5 Document maintenance

Describe  how  this  document  is  maintained  and  how   the   requirements
identification will be handled over time. Typically describe how removal  or
addition of requirements is  handled  (e.g.  numbers  are  never  renumbered
after removal; requirements can only be added at the end of a  section  with
the next higher number).
General rules for document maintenance are described  in  [WI_REQ].  Do  not
repeat these here.
Additional requirements can only be added at the end of a section  with  the
next higher number.
If a requirement is removed, the number remains empty.


6 Definitions, acronyms & abbreviations

A list of all definitions, abbreviations and terms used  in  this  document,
together with a short explanation.
Definitions:
Instant Messenger      An instant messenger is an application, which  allows
                 instant text  communication  between  two  or  more  people
                 through a network such as the Internet.
Status      Predefined presence identifier.  With  setting  the  status  the
                 user can let others know if he is actively  using  your  PC
                 (or TV  in  our  case).  In  MSN  Messenger  you  have  the
                 following statuses: Offline, Online, Busy, Idle,  Be  Right
                 Back, Away, On the Phone and Out to Lunch.
Blocking    When you block someone, you  prevent  that  person  from  seeing
           your  status  (you  always  appear  offline)  and  sending   you
           messages.
Buddy Friend, family member, co-worker  or  other  person  who  is  manually
           added to your buddy list.
Buddy list  List of buddies with whom  the  user  can  communicate  in  real
           time.
Contact list     See buddy list.
Passport    .NET Passport is an online service that makes  it  possible  for
           you to use your e-mail address and a single password to sign  in
           to any .NET Passport-participating Web site or service.  One  of
           these services is the MSN Messenger.

 General description


1 Product perspective

 • If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be
   stated here.
   Otherwise, if the FRS defines a product that is a component of a larger
   system or project, then describe the relation and identify the interfaces
   between the component and the larger system or project.
 • Describe here all external connections to the product in terms of
   connectors, hardware and software. The use of a context diagram is
   allowed if the technique is clear to the customer. Also identify the
   protocol interfaces (for more information, refer to section 4.2) and the
   data interfaces (refer to section 4.3).
 • If the FRS is part of a product line, refer to the  product  roadmap  and
   identify the relation between the product and the product roadmap.
The MSN messenger xlet is a MHP version of the popular  PC  application.  It
is an application to demonstrate the possibilities of MHP and Platform-i.

The Platform-i MSN messenger application is independent of other projects.

2 Product(s)

Identify the product(s) to be produced by name.
In case of more than one product, define how in the  rest  of  the  document
the diversity between the products is described.
For each product, add the following section:

The produced product will be an MHP MSN messenger xlet.


1 MSN messenger xlet

Explain shortly what this product will do. Give a summary of  the  functions
that this product will perform.
Also describe explicitly what the product will not do (but  do  not  add  an
exhaustive list; restrict the list to the non-trivial aspects).
With the xlet the user shall be able to see online friends, chat  with  them
and see which TV program they are watching. Unlike the PC variant, the  xlet
cannot transfer files and doesn’t have webcam support.

3 User characteristics

Describe those general characteristics of the  users  of  the  product  that
account for the functional requirements.  Describe  per  type  of  user  the
context of use in terms of the privileges and the  tasks.  Typical  examples
of users are: end  users,  operators,  factory  users,  service  users,  and
dealers.
Also, non-human users that interface with the product can be included  here.
Typically, however, non-human usage is a communication  interface,  see  4.2
for more information.
There are only end-users.

4 Assumptions & constraints

Provide  a  short  description  of  external   factors   that   affect   the
requirements in the FRS (assumptions) or that will  limit  the  options  for
designing the system (constraints).
An example of an assumption is that a specific chip will be  available.  If,
in fact, this chip is not available, then this  FRS  would  have  to  change
accordingly.
Examples of constraints are: the operating  system  to  use,  interfaces  to
other applications,  safety  considerations,  regularity  policies,  higher-
order  language  requirements.  Keep  in  mind  that  only  the  non-trivial
constraints should be mentioned here.
If we cannot use the MSN messenger service  protocol  this  FRS  has  to  be
adjusted to reflect the new situation.


Functional requirements

For each  function  (or  feature)  category,  or  if  appropriate  for  each
individual function,  define  the  functional  (behaviour)  requirements  by
means of a short introduction of the function, followed by a  definition  of
inputs and associated outputs (results, effects) on that function.
The User-interface specific aspects of the FRS  are  not  included  in  this
chapter (see chapter Error! Reference source not  found.).  E.g.  for  a  TV
set, define here the characteristics of volume control. The  fact  that  the
volume control button is present both  on  the  TV-set  and  on  the  remote
control is defined in chapter Error! Reference source not found.).
This chapter will have a section layout that is specific for the product.
It is advised however to at least use the following section layout  to  make
a clear distinction between the types  of  user  (e.g.  end  user,  factory,
service user).

1 End user functions

Define in function categories the typical functions that  are  available  to
the end user.
An example layout could be:
3.1.1 <Function category 1>
3.1.2 <Function category 2>

1 Presence

      P1.0 Use of Passport to login to the messenger
           P1.1 With the use of an existing Passport account the  user  can
           login to the messenger.
           P1.2 It is not possible to create a new Passport account.

      P2.0 Maintenance of users own status
           P2.1 Ability to change and maintain the status which is  visible
           to the buddies. The application provides a list where  the  end-
           user can choose the new status.

      P3.0 See the presence status of your buddies
           P3.1 The application will display the status  of  the  end-users
           buddies.
           P3.2 When a buddy changes  his  status,  the  application  shall
           update it.

      P4.0 Own Nickname
           P4.1 The end-user is able to change the nickname with which  the
           user is visible to the buddies.

      P5.0 Nickname of buddies
           P5.1 Show the nicknames of the end-users buddies  on  the  buddy
           list.
           P5.2 The application updates the displayed nick in  the  contact
           list when a buddy changes the nickname.

      P6.0 Appoint an user-defined nickname
           P6.1 The  application  provides  the  possibility  to  assign  a
           nickname to a specified  buddy;  this  nickname  has  preference
           above the nickname set by the buddy itself.

      P7.0 Add buddies to your contact list
           P7.1 The application provides an option to add a  buddy  to  the
      buddy list.

      P8.0 Delete buddies from your contact list
           P8.1 The application has an option to delete a  buddy  from  the
      buddy list.

      P9.0 Blocking a buddy
           P9.1 The application has an option to block certain buddies.

External interface requirements


1 Physical devices

Define the actual  input  and  output  devices  of  the  product,  typically
represented by a picture of the layout of the device.
Examples of input devices are: remote control, mouse, and local keypad.
Examples of output devices are: LCD, TV screen, LED.
Input device: Remote control and maybe a wireless keyboard.
Output device: TV screen.


2 Communication interfaces

Describe the external protocols that are used in connecting the  product  to
its environment (see also 2.1). For standard protocols, use a reference  and
describe what is supported  of  the  standard.  For  proprietary  protocols,
define the protocol itself. (Often, the protocol definition is described  in
a separate document; in that case include a reference here.)
The used protocol for communication is the .NET messenger service  protocol.
The used version of this protocol will  be  MSNPv8  which  is  the  standard
protocol at this moment.

3 Data requirements

Describe the external data that is interfacing to the system. This can be  a
database or a data stream format. (Often, the data  description  is  defined
in a separate document; in that case include a reference here.)
Not applicable.
 • Non-functional requirements are typically requirements  in  the  area  of
   e.g. performance, reliability and  maintainability.  They  often  have  a
   system wide character and cannot be attached  to  a  specific  functional
   requirement. (This also holds  for  section  2.4.)  Make  sure  that  the
   requirements are measurable; e.g. “maintainability is important” is not a
   requirement.
 • The following list defines possibly relevant product quality attributes:

 • This list is to be used as  a  checklist  to  derive  the  non-functional
   requirements.

 • Preferably, do not use the complete list of  attributes  as  a  table  of
   contents. Do not extensively discuss or incorporate those attributes that
   are regarded less relevant for the application.
 • Note that some product quality  attributes  might  result  in  functional
   requirements (e.g. security can be realised with  a  password  mechanism,
   usability is often implicitly included in section Error! Reference source
   not found., time-behaviour requirements can be addressed specifically per
   functional requirement). These  are  typically  described  in  the  other
   chapters of this document. In that case, a reference from this chapter to
   the other chapters can be useful, to understand how the quality attribute
   is achieved with functional requirements.
