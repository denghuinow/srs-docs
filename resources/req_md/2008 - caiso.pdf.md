1. Overview 
  
Following the complete or major loss of system generation (blackout), it will be 
necessary to establish initial generation that can supply a source of electric power to 
other system generation and begin system restoration.  These initiating generators are 
referred to as system Black Start generators.  They must be able to self-start without 
any source of off-site electric power and maintain adequate voltage and frequency 
while energizing isolated transmission facilities and auxiliary loads of other 
generators. Generators that can safely reject load down to their auxiliary load are 
another form of Black Start generator that can aid system restoration, but are not 
addressed with this Black Start Capability Plan (BCP). 
 
From a planning perspective, a system Black Start Capability Plan (BCP) is necessary 
to ensure that the quantity and location of system Black Start generators are sufficient 
and that they can perform their expected functions as specified in overall coordinated 
WECC BCP. 
 
The CAISO may from time to time test Unit(s) designated to provide Black Start 
service (through an RMR or Interim Black Start Contract) by requiring the Unit to 
deliver Black Start service pursuant to a Test Dispatch Notice provided to Owner’s 
Scheduling Coordinator using the procedures described in the Tariff Sections 4.2 and 
4.3.  Such Test Dispatch Notice shall be marked “Black Start Test Notice.”  The Black 
Start Test shall be performed in accordance with the Ancillary Services Requirements 
Protocol in the CAISO Tariff.  The CAISO shall not request a Black Start Test for a 
hydroelectric Unit during periods of constrained water availability.

2. Grid Planning 
 
The following provides general guidance for CAISO Black Start planning: 
 
Step 
Description 
1 
The CAISO determines the amount and location of Black Start Generation 
it requires through contingency studies that are used as the basis of the 
CAISO’s emergency plans. The studies specify: 
• The initiating disturbance, 
• The magnitude of the Outage, including the extent of the Outage (local 
area, CAISO Controlled Grid, or WECC), 
• The assumed status of Generation after the initiating disturbance, 
• The status of interconnections,  
• The system Demand level at the time of the disturbance, 
• The interconnection support, and assumptions regarding the availability 
of support from other utilities to help restore Generation and Demand 
• The generator performance including a percentage of Black Start units 
(to be determined by the CAISO) which are expected to fail to start, 
• Expected transmission system damage. 
2 
The CAISO annually verifies that the number, size, availability, and 
location of system Black Start generating units are sufficient to meet 
WECC restoration plan requirements for the CAISO Balancing Authority 
Area. 
3 
The CAISO documents the Cranking Paths, including initial switching 
requirements, between each Black Start generating unit and the units to be 
started and provides this documentation for review to WECC upon 
request. Such documentation may include Cranking Path diagrams. 
4 
The CAISO Black Start planning evaluation process includes the 
following: 
• Diverse fuel resources for Black Start power for generating units, 
• Available cranking and transmission paths, 
• Communication adequacy, 
• Unit capability of maintaining adequate regulation of voltage and 
frequency, 
• Generator protection and control systems during the abnormal 
conditions that will exist during system restoration, 
• Limited energy resources (e.g., hydro, pumped storage hydro, 
compressed air) are selected sparingly. 
5 
The planning evaluation process is coordinated, as appropriate, with the 
Black Start capability plans of transmission owners and neighboring 
Balancing Authorities. 
6 
The CAISO annually enters into RMR and Interim Black Start Contracts 
with generators that satisfy the results of the annual planning evaluation 
process.

endanger the safety of any person, damage equipment, harms the environment, 
or violates any applicable law, regulation, or operating limit. 
Black Start Testing 
Minimal 
Requirements 
The following requirements apply to: 
• Voluntary Black Start units that desire a CAISO Black-Start 
status, 
• Interim Black Start units, 
• RMR Black Start Units: 
 
Step 
Description 
1 
The owner or operator of any Voluntary Black Start unit that desires a Black 
Start generating unit status with the CAISO Balancing Authority shall: 
• Demonstrate at least every five years, through simulation or testing, that 
the unit can perform its intended functions as required by the WECC BCP 
(if any) and of this testing section.  
• Submit documentation of the test results and analysis to the CAISO, 
WECC, or NERC upon any request. 
• Submit any past reports for Black Start tests with the CAISO and WECC. 
o Those Participants who do not currently test their Black Start capability, 
will be required to test their Black Start capability.  
• Within 24 hours of conducting a Black Start test, all Participants will notify 
the CAISO RT Dispatcher by phone indicating the success or failure of the 
test.  
• Within 14 days of performing a Black Start test, all Participants will file a 
letter with the CAISO regarding the success or failure of the test.   
2 
Testing records shall include the dates of the tests, the duration of the tests, 
and an indication of whether the tests met the requirements of this Black Start 
Testing section. 
3 
The Black Start unit must have the ability to maintain voltage within 
emergency voltage limits over a range of loading from no external load to full 
external load in accordance with NERC reliability standards. 
4 
The Black Start unit must be equipped with governors that are capable of 
operating in an isochronous mode. 
5 
Adequate transmission capacity shall be available to connect the Black Start 
facility to the source providing station services to other specified generating 
stations. 
6 
The Black Start unit must be capable of starting and energizing the applicable 
transmission path without assistance from the electrical system.

8 
The following start-up/synchronizing time limits shall apply to the Black 
Start testing units: 
• Hydroelectric generating units or combustion gas turbines - within 30 
minutes of the initiation of the Black Start process, 
• Industrial gas turbines - within 60 minutes of the initiation of the Black 
Start process, 
• Hot, steam-driven turbines, within 2.5 hours of the initiation of the Black 
Start process. 
• If the certified Black Start facility is in another reliability coordinator area 
or is comprised of an unspecified technology then specific start time 
limits are negotiated. 
These times include ICU start-up, normal start-up of the unit, plus switching 
time for the actual synchronizing of the unit.   
9 
The minimum run time duration (the generation time after being 
synchronized to the grid) of a Black Start test is 10 minutes. 
10 
Submit a CAISO market schedule for any test energy.

4. Recordkeeping 
 
The following describes the CAISO’s commitment to Black Start 
recordkeeping: 
 
Step 
Description 
1 
• The CAISO maintains a Black Start database that contains all Black 
Start generators designated for use during a system restoration.  (E-501 
System Restoration - restricted distribution). 
• The Black Start database is reviewed and updated on at least an annual 
basis.   
• The Black Start database includes the name, location, megawatt 
capacity, type of unit, latest date of test, and starting method. 
2 
 
If… 
Then… 
The a Black Start unit 
did not successfully 
pass the CAISO 
Black Start criteria 
specified in this 
procedure, 
An explanation and a plan to address and 
correct the deficiency shall be provided to the 
CAISO by the generator owner/operator.  The 
results of the testing and the justification for 
the periodicity of the testing shall be provided 
to WECC or NERC on request (within 30 
days).

5. Training 
 
The following describes the CAISO’s commitment to Black Start Operator 
training: 
 
Step 
Commitment 
1 
The Real-time Grid Operators are trained at least annually for system 
restoration including the use of Black Start capable units. The training 
encompasses the integrated coordination of the following: 
• NERC requirements 
• WECC requirements 
• E-501  - System Restoration 
• E-501A Black Start Capable Units 
• Black Start Capability Plan 
• Simulations of full or partial system shutdowns and restoration 
(including a critique report of the simulation).
