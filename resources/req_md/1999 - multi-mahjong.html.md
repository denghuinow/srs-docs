### 1\. Introduction

This document formally states the requirements for the MultiMahjong product.

These requirements have been prioritised into three levels:

     1. _Essential_  
The minimum set of requirements for the product to be accepted (see Section
8).

     2. _Highly Desirable_  
Requirements that are considered to be likely inclusions to the product, time
permitting.

     3. _Desirable_  
Requirements that are not likely to be added in this version, but should be
considered for future modifications.

MultiMahjong is a product consisting of two programs - a MultiMahjongServer
and a MultiMahjongClient. This Server/Client architecture will allow up to 4
players to play Mahjong against each other over a TCP/IP network. The
MultiMahjongClient program will also allow 1 player to play in a stand-alone
mode.

As any game of Mahjong requires 4 players to play, and there may not be 4
people available for a network game, the game will allow users to choose
enough computer opponents to make up the required 4 players. In a single
player game, the user will play against 3 computer opponents.

To play the game, users will use the MultiMahjongClient. The
MultiMahjongServer is to reside on a TCP/IP server and will communicate with
MultiMahjongClients.

The client requires the product for commercial purposes. The
MultiMahjongClient program is to be sold to potential users (see Section
5.1.1) and the MultiMahjongServer is to initially reside on a server owned or
operated by the client.

This document contains many references to the rules of Mahjong, specifically
the Chinese rules of Mahjong. It is assumed that the reader of this document
is familiar with these rules as many of the requirements are Mahjong specific.
These rules can be found in the following book:

Carkner, K.J. "How to play Mah Jong",  
1993, Penguin Books Australia Ltd.



### 2\. The Existing Logical System

The client has no existing system for MultiMahjong.



### 3\. The Proposed Logical System

As this is only a _suggestion_ for the proposed logical system, all
requirements mentioned in this section are Level 2 requirements.

#### 3.1 Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)

The following diagrams show the flow of data between the entities of the
MultiMahjong system:

#### ![](srs_files/level0_dfd.gif)

**Figure 3.1.1 - Level 0 DFD of the MultiMahjong System**



**![](srs_files/level1_dfd.gif)**

**Figure 3.1.2 - Level 1 DFD of the MultiMahjong System**

Note that these diagrams only describe the top level processes and the data
that flows between them. They do not describe the functions of the
MultiMahjongClient and MultiMahjongServer programs as the processes are shared
between both programs. The functionality of the MultiMahjongClient and
MultiMahjongServer programs is described in more detail in Section 4.

### 4\. Functional Requirements

This section states the requirements that relate to the functionality of the
MultiMahjong system. Each requirement has been prioritised according to the
levels set out in the Introduction (see Section 1). Requirements that relate
to what is displayed on the user's screen are defined in Section 6.

Note that for single player games, the MultiMahjongServer will not be required
and the player need not be connected to a TCP/IP network. Although many
requirements mention that the MultiMahjongClient will send certain information
to the MultiMahjongServer, in the single player game, this is not the case. In
a single player game, the MultiMahjongClient will intercept this information
and process it internally. The reference to the MultiMahjongServer is made to
reduce duplicate requirements.

#### 4.1 The MultiMahjongServer

_Level 1 Requirements:_

**4.1.1**   | The MultiMahjongServer will be designed to reside on a central computer (server) that is connected to a TCP/IP network and has a unique IP address.  
---|---  
**4.1.2**   | The MultiMahjongServer will allow connections from MultiMahjongClients and communicate with them using IP.  
**4.1.3** | The MultiMahjongServer will serve as a node for MultiMahjongClients. That is, it will be able to relay data received from one MultiMahjongClient to other MultiMahjongClients that request it.  
  
_Level 2 Requirements:_

**4.1.4**   | The MultiMahjongServer will automate the game initialisation functions (as opposed to the MultiMahjongClient doing them), such as: randomising tile order, randomising seating position and storing the "Game Info" database (see Figure 3.1.2).  
---|---  
**4.1.5**   | The MultiMahjongServer will contain a High Scores list with the names and scores of the top MultiMahjong players.  
  
_Level 3 Requirements:_

**4.1.6**   | The MultiMahjongServer will allow players on MultiMahjongClient programs to chat with each other in real time.  
---|---  
**4.1.7**   | The MultiMahjongServer will allow players on MultiMahjongClient programs to modify their own names and icons during gameplay (as opposed to only at the beginning).  
**4.1.8**   | The MultiMahjongServer will support an architecture whereby all Computer Opponents (CO) required will reside on it instead of on the MultiMahjongClient programs.  
**4.1.9**   | The MultiMahjongServer will have a graphical user interface with which the administrator of the server can get log information and change game settings.  
**4.1.10**   | The MultiMahjongServer will be able to save preferences to a file and read from that file at start-up.  
  
Note that all requirements hereafter are concerned with the MultiMahjongClient
program.

#### 4.2 Beginning the Game

_Level 1 Requirements:_

**4.2.1**   | When the user begins the MultiMahjongClient program, they will be able to choose to create a new multi player game, to create a new single player game, to join an existing multi player game, or to quit the program. These options will be available at any stage while the program is running as long as there is no game currently being played by the user (see Section 4.4 for more details about quitting).  
---|---  
**4.2.2** | When a user creates a new multi player game, they must:  
| **4.2.2.1** | Enter their name.  
---|---  
**4.2.2.2** | Choose an icon from a predetermined list.  
**4.2.2.3**   | Decide the number of human and computer opponents they want. As any game of Mahjong requires 4 players, the MultiMahjongClient will limit the user to choosing 4 players in total.  
**4.2.2.4** | Set the score limit for winning a hand of Mahjong.  
**4.2.2.5** | When all the necessary human players have joined the game, the user may choose to begin the game.  
**4.2.3**   | The MultiMahjongClient must send this game initialisation information to the MultiMahjongServer so that the MultiMahjongServer can create a new game.  
**4.2.4**   | The processing for any Computer Opponents (CO) (see Section 4.5 for more detail) will be done by the MultiMahjongClient program. In a single player game, the MultiMahjongClient will need to process for 3 COs. In a multi player game with 2 human players, each MultiMahjongClient will support 1 CO. In a multi player game with 3 human players, only 1 of the 3 MultiMahjongClients will support a CO. Obviously, in a multi player game with 4 human players, no CO is required.  
**4.2.5**   | When a user creates a new single player game, they must:  
| **4.2.5.1** | Enter their name.  
---|---  
**4.2.5.2**   | Choose an icon from a predetermined list.  
**4.2.5.3**   | Set the score limit for winning a hand of Mahjong.  
**4.2.6**   | When a user selects the option to join an existing game, the MultiMahjongClient will retrieve a list of any games that still require players from the MultiMahjongServer.  
**4.2.7**   | When a user wishes to join a multi player game, they must:  
| **4.2.7.1**   | Enter their name.  
---|---  
**4.2.7.2**   | Choose an icon from a predetermined list.  
**4.2.7.3**   | Choose which of the available games they wish to join.  
**4.2.8**   | The MultiMahjongClient must send this join information to the MultiMahjongServer.  
**4.2.9**   | In a multi player game, each MultiMahjongClient must retrieve the following data from the MultiMahjongServer:  
| **4.2.9.1**   | Whether it must support a CO.  
---|---  
**4.2.9.2**   | The score limit for a hand.  
**4.2.9.3** | All players' names, icons and seating positions.  
**4.2.9.4** | The tiles of the human and CO (optional) player supported on the MultiMahjongClient.  
  
_Level 2 Requirements:_

**4.2.10**   | The list of un-started games that the MultiMahjongClient fetches from the MultiMahjongServer will be displayed in such a way that users can see the following information about each game:  
| **4.2.10.1**   | The name and icon of the player who created the game.  
---|---  
**4.2.10.2**   | The score limit for winning a hand.  
**4.2.10.3** | The number of places that still need to be filled before the game can commence.  
**4.2.11**   | The MultiMahjongClient will save the user preferences in a file and read them in when the program begins.  
  
_Level 3 Requirements:_

**4.2.12** | Users who create a new game will be able to change the ability level of any CO involved in the game. There will be 3 levels available: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.  
---|---  
**4.2.13**   | Users who create a new game will be able to choose to play different variations of Mahjong rules other than those described in Section 4.3.1. The variations will include the Cleared Hand variation and the Japanese variation (see the rulebook for more detail).  
**4.2.14** | Any user who creates or joins a game will be able to upload their own JPEG or GIF image that they wish to have displayed above their name, if they do not wish to use a preset icon.  
  
#### 4.3 Playing the Game

_Level 1 Requirements:_

**4.3.1**   | The MultiMahjongClient must only allow players to make moves according to the Chinese rules of Mahjong as described in the rulebook, "How to Play Mah Jong".  
---|---  
**4.3.2**   | The MultiMahjongClient will inform the user whose turn it is to pick up a tile.  
**4.3.3** | The MultiMahjongClient will retrieve other players' changes in the game situation from the MultiMahjongServer. The user's screen is then updated to display these changes. The following game changes are displayed:  
| **4.3.3.1**   | Another player picks up a tile from the wall.  
---|---  
**4.3.3.2**   | Another player exposes/reveals a set of tiles.  
**4.3.3.3** | Another player discards a tile.  
**4.3.4**   | If the configurations of: the current discard, the tiles in a user's hand, and the player whose turn it is, would allow the user to Chow/Pung/Kong/Mahjong under the Chinese rules of Mahjong, the MultiMahjongClient will inform the user that they can do so. If they choose to take this action, then the MultiMahjongClient must send this information to the MultiMahjongServer.  
**4.3.5**   | User's will be able to pick up a tile from the wall if it is their turn. If they choose to pick up, the MultiMahjongClient must send this information to the MultiMahjongServer.  
**4.3.6**   | User's will be able to discard a tile if they have picked one up. When they choose to discard, the MultiMahjongClient must send this information to the MultiMahjongServer.  
**4.3.7**   | The MultiMahjongClient must inform the user if another player is fishing.  
**4.3.8**   | The MultiMahjongClient must inform the user if another player goes Mahjong. The wind of the round is also updated (if required).  
**4.3.9**   | The MultiMahjongClient must inform the user if the hand has ended in a draw.  
  
_Level 2 Requirements:_

**4.3.10**   | The MultiMahjongClient will keep the user's tiles in order.  
---|---

**4.3.12** | Users will be able to turn the sound on or off at any stage during the game.  
**4.3.13**   | Users will have access to the User's Documentation online (see Section 7.2) at any stage during the game.  
**4.3.14**   | Users will be able to view the High Scores list that is located on the MultiMahjongServer.  
**4.3.15**   | The MultiMahjongClient will automate the picking up of a tile from the wall if the user has no other option.  
  
_Level 3 Requirements:_

**4.3.16**   | User's will be able to Undo their last move if playing in single player mode.  
---|---  
**4.3.17**   | User's will be able to Save their game if playing in single player mode.  
**4.3.18** | User's will be able to chat with each other in real time.  
**4.3.19**   | User's will be able to change their icons/pictures and names during the game.  
  
#### 4.4 Ending the Game

_Level 1 Requirements:_

**4.4.1**   | The game will end when all 4 rounds have been played or if the user chooses to end the game.  
---|---  
**4.4.2**   | The user will be able to end the game at any stage of the game. The user will then be able to quit the program or begin/join a new game.  
**4.4.3** | The MultiMahjongServer will inform all MultiMahjongClients connected to the game that the game has ended. Users of any MultiMahjongClient previously connected to the game will have the choice to quit the program or to begin/join a new game.  
  
_Level 2 Requirements:_

**4.4.4**   | If a user leaves the game prematurely, a new CO is created on another user's machine to fill their place. This CO will take over the user's current position and circumstance within the game. This CO will play at an ability level as defined in the Level 2 Requirements for the CO (see Section 4.5.6).  
---|---  
  
_Level 3 Requirements:_

**4.4.5**   | If a user leaves the game prematurely, a new CO is created on another user's machine to fill their place. The user who created the game will decide at what level (see Section 4.5.8) the CO will play at.  
---|---  
  
#### 4.5 Computer Opponent (CO)

_Level 1 Requirements:_

**4.5.1**   | The CO must play moves according to the Chinese rules of Mahjong.

### 5\. Non-Functional Requirements

This section states all the requirements of the MultiMahjong system that are
not related to the functionality of the MultiMahjong system.

#### 5.1 Nature of the Users

#### 5.1.1 MultiMahjongClient

_Level 1 Requirements:_

**5.1.1.1**   | The potential users of the MultiMahjongClient product will be anyone who enjoys playing or is interested in the game of Mahjong.  
---|---  
**5.1.1.2**   | The product is aimed at users who have a basic knowledge how to operate a PC, Macintosh or Unix box (see Section 5.3.1).  
**5.1.1.3** | Users who wish to play multi player Mahjong will not need to have advanced knowledge of TCP/IP networking. It is assumed however, that the computer has been configured correctly to connect to a TCP/IP network.  
**5.1.1.4**   | Prior knowledge of Mahjong rules is not necessary, as the product will be designed for both players with some or no experience.  
  
#### 5.1.2 MultiMahjongServer

_Level 1 Requirements:_

**5.1.2.1**   | The user of the MultiMahjongServer will most likely have general knowledge of a Web Server environment.  
---|---  
**5.1.2.2**   | The user will need to know how to set-up and operate a TCP/IP server.  
**5.1.2.3** | The user will understand the basic principles of networking and know any networking information associated with the server the MultiMahjongServer program is run on (hostname and IP address).  
  
#### 5.2 Error Handling

Every error that occurs during program execution can be classified into two
types - fatal and nonfatal errors. The distinction between the two is that the
program is unable to continue to execute upon encountering a fatal error.

#### 5.2.1 Nonfatal errors:

_Level 1 Requirements:_

**5.2.1.1**   | If a nonfatal error occurs, a dialogue box reporting the nature of error will be displayed.  
---|---  
**5.2.1.2**   | As the error is classified 'nonfatal', the user will be able to continue the current game.  
  
_Level 2 Requirements:_

**5.2.1.3**   | An option to access the online troubleshooting guide (Section 7.2.4) is included in the error dialogue box.  
---|---

8\. Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance criteria for the product are defined by all Level 1
requirements. That is, Level 1 contains the minimum requirements that have to
be met for the project to be accepted. Levels 2 and 3 represent likely and
future inclusions respectively, the feasibility of which will be determined
during the project.

Note that Level 1 requirements may not necessarily be implemented if they are
replaced by corresponding Level 2 or 3 requirements.



### 9\. Examples of Behaviour

This section describes a possible scenario that incorporates some of the
requirements mentioned in this document. As some of the requirements used are
Level 2 and Level 3 requirements, the actual implementation of the product may
not reflect this scenario exactly.

#### 9.1 Beginning the Game

The administrator (5.1.2) runs the MultiMahjongServer program on a server
(4.1.1). This program begins running and waits for MultiMahjongClients to
connect (4.1.2).

A user (5.1.1), Bob, runs the MultiMahjongClient program on another computer.
A dialogue box (6.3.6) appears on the Bob's computer displaying the options to
begin the game (4.2.1, 4.2.2). Bob enters his name (4.2.2.1), chooses an icon
(4.2.2.2), sets the score limit (4.2.2.4) and decides to select one human
opponent and two CO opponents (4.2.2.3). Bob then waits for a human opponent
to join.

Another user, Sally, also runs the MultiMahjongClient program, enters her
details and selects to join an existing game (4.2.7) from the dialogue box.
The MultiMahjongClient retrieves a list of the available games (including
Bob's) from the MultiMahjongServer (4.2.6). The MultiMahjongClient displays
this list on the screen (6.3.7). Sally selects Bob's game and joins the game.

Bob sees that Sally has joined and selects to begin the game (4.2.2.5). The
MultiMahjongServer receives the begin game command from Bob's
MultiMahjongClient and it initialises all information necessary to begin the
game (4.1.4) and sends it to both Sally's and Bob's MultiMahjongClients
(4.1.3). The processing for one CO player will be done by the
MultiMahjongClient running on Bob's machine, the other by the
MultiMahjongClient running on Sally's machine (4.2.4).

#### 9.2 Playing the Game

A main window containing all the game information (6.3.4) is displayed on both
Sally's and Bob's screens.

Bob, Sally and the CO's take turns in picking up (4.3.5) and discarding
(4.3.6) tiles . After Sally discards a certain tile, Bob can Chow (4.3.4), and
a button named 'Chow' in his main window becomes active (6.3.4.6). Bob chooses
to Chow by clicking on this button. Bob's MultiMahjongClient sends this move
to the MultiMahjongServer (4.3.4), which subsequently sends this move to the
other MultiMahjongClient (4.1.3). The tiles in both Bob's and Sally's main
window are updated to show that Bob has Chow'ed (4.3.3.2).

The hand continues in this fashion, with all players making moves within the
Chinese rules of Mahjong (4.3.1). After a few moves, the combination of tiles
in Sally's hand allows her to Mahjong and a button named 'Mahjong' becomes
active in her main window (6.3.4.6). Sally clicks this button and a new hand
begins. When all hands have been played, the Wind of the Round indicator is
updated (4.3.8) and a new round begins. The game continues in this fashion

#### 9.3 Ending the Game

At the end of the 4th round, Bob goes Mahjong. Bob's MultiMahjongClient sends
this information to the MultiMahjongServer (4.3.8) which sends it to the other
MultiMahjongClient (4.3.1). The main window on both MultiMahjongClients is
closed and the original dialogue box (6.3.6) is displayed (4.4.3).

Both Bob and Sally choose to quit the program and the MultiMahjongClients on
both machines exit (4.4.1).
