Software Requirements Specification 
 
1 Introduction 
1.1 Purpose 
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a collection and organization of all the 
requirements surrounding a project.  As the Vision Document was a broad statement of user 
needs, goals and objectives, and features of the system, the SRS begins the detailing of those 
needs and features, and how they are going to be implemented in the solution.  The SRS is a 
collection, or package, of artifacts that describe the complete external behavior of the system 
(i.e., what the system has to do to deliver those features). 
 
Following the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and its iterative nature, the SRS is not a frozen 
document, but rather a living artifact.  It has a number of uses as the developer begins the 
implementation efforts.  It serves as a basis for communication between all parties (i.e., between 
the developers themselves, between the developers and the stakeholders).  The SRS will also 
serve as input to software testing and quality assurance checks.  During testing, Test Cases will 
be created to ensure that the developed system does indeed fulfill the requirements outlined in 
the SRS. 
1.2 Overview 
The Water Use Tracking (WUT) System’s SRS, as outlined above, is a collection of artifacts that 
have been developed separately during the Implementation Phase of the project.  This packaging 
of artifacts will include information from the following documents: 
• Vision Document 
• Requirements Workshops Summaries 
• Requirement Traceability Matrix 
• Use Case Model and Use Cases 
• Supplementary Specification 
 
This SRS outlines the process the WUT Project Development Team followed to gather the 
requirements for the project.  This document will also describe how the requirement statements 
gathered from the stakeholders make their way into use case documents and, eventually, into 
features of the system.

2 Project Scope 
The vision of the Water Use Tracking (WUT) System, as captured during the Executive 
Stakeholders Workshop, defines the system as: 
 
“A GIS-based system that allows District employees and external customers to spatially and 
temporally track and analyze key Regulatory and Resource Management data.” 
 
This system will support Southwest Florida Water Management District’s (SWFWMD) activities 
defined in the Southern Water Use Caution Area (SWUCA) Management Plan and to validate 
and assess the results of the SWUCA II Rules.  Although this system is being built to support the 
efforts within the SWUCA, it will support the same functionality for anywhere within the 
District. 
2.1  Problem Statement 
Rules are in the process of being implemented in support of the SWUCA Recovery Strategy that 
has no current, automated way of being validated or assessed in their fulfillment of the needs of 
the plan.  One problem is no formal or consistent system exists at the District (manual or 
automated) to comprehensively track and analyze geographic and temporal trends in permitted 
and actual water uses within the SWUCA.  Currently, tracking of spatial and temporal trends in 
permitted and actual water uses is done using manual and semi-automated methodologies by a 
number of groups in the District.   
 
Examples of current work include monthly summary reports of permitted pumpage developed by 
the Technical Services Department, annual water use estimates developed by the Conservation 
Projects Department, and ad hoc maps of permitted pumpage developed by the Mapping and GIS 
Section (MGIS).  This approach is staff time intensive, and since data sources and methodologies 
vary between different groups conducting these analyses, it may lead to inconsistent or 
apparently conflicting results.  This is further complicated by the fact that current database 
management systems and data collection activities were not specifically designed to support 
these types of activities.  The result is that the current system does not adequately support the 
types of analyses required for successful implementation of the SWUCA Management Plan. 
2.2 Product Position Statement 
The WUT Project will provide software for several different customer types.  As outlined in the 
SWUCA Permitted Water Use Tracking Application – Feasibility Study, the primary groups who 
will be using the system are: 
 
Water Use Permit (WUP) Evaluators – The system will assist in the WUP review process. 
 
Technical Services Staff – The system will be used to track and analyze long-term trends in 
permitted and actual water use and to assist in identifying underlying causes for these trends 
(land use change, socio-economic conditions, environmental factors, etc.).  It will also provide 
tools that can be used to aggregate permitted and actual pumpage over specified geographic areas 
(model grid cells, counties, Most Impacted Area (MIA), watershed, etc.).

Records and Data Staff – The system will provide tools to assist in the quality control/quality 
assurance of WUP data. 
 
Resource Conservation and Development Department – The system will provide information 
that can be used to assist in the calibration of ground water models.  The system will also provide 
information on WUPs that can support the establishment and monitoring of Minimum Flows and 
Levels.  In addition, the system will provide information that assists in the development of 
estimated water use 
 
Planning Department – The system will provide tools to assist in studies analyzing impacts of 
changing demographics and economic conditions on water use within the SWUCA. 
 
Executive Staff/Governing Board – The system will provide standard reports that are published 
as hardcopy or web-accessible documents.  Web accessible maps and documents could be 
interactive, allow users to zoom, pan, and query areas of interest. 
 
External Customers – External customers potentially include local governments, the media, and 
the general public.  Standard interactive map interfaces will provide information in a consistent, 
low maintenance environment. 
 
Other Users – This system is in line with the objectives of the CWM Information Technology 
initiative presented to the Governing Board in June 2002.  It will provide improved access to 
WUP data for all District staff.

2.4 Project Environment 
2.4.1 Hardware/Software Environment 
The proposed system does not appear to require any significant hardware or software resources 
beyond that which currently exists, or is planned for implementation, at the District. 
2.4.1.1 IBM DB2 Data Server 
The IBM DB2 data server was upgraded in January 2003 and it is anticipated that it has 
sufficient capacity to support the proposed system.  It is likewise anticipated that the current DB2 
database software configuration will support the proposed system.  
2.4.1.2 HP-UX ArcSDE/Oracle Data Server 
The District is currently retiring the obsolete HP Tru-64 computer system and replacing it with 
an HP-UX system.  It is anticipated that when this upgrade is completed in fiscal year (FY) 2004 
that the system will have sufficient capacity to support the proposed system.  It is likewise 
anticipated that when the upgrade is completed, current ArcSDE/Oracle database system 
configuration will support the proposed system. 
2.4.1.3 Communications/Data Network 
The primary impact of this system on the network will occur during the transfer of data between 
the IBM and HP-UX systems.  Since this transfer will occur only during non-business hours, it is 
not anticipated that it will have a significant impact on the current network. 
2.4.1.4 Web/ArcIMS Servers 
The current Web/ArcIMS Server environment will be expanded in FY 2004 to support of CWM 
activities and it is anticipated that it will have sufficient capacity to support the proposed system.  
In the event that these servers are not adequate, they are relatively inexpensive to upgrade. 
2.4.1.5 Desktop Workstations 
It is anticipated that this system will operate within the ArcGIS ArcView and ArcIMS web 
browser environment that is currently implemented at the District. 
2.5 Product Perspective 
The system will require a combination of permitting, geographic, and water resource data 
derived from the following sources. 
2.5.1 WUP Data 
The data source for WUPs is the Regulatory Database (RDB).  This database is implemented in 
the IBM DB2 environment on the District's IBM mainframe data server located in the Tampa 
Data Center.  The Records and Data Department is the primary entity responsible for the entry 
and maintenance of the data in the RDB.  The Information Resources Department (IRD) is 
responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the RDB. 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project –

Software Requirements Specification

2.5.2 Geographic Data 
The data source for geographic data is the GIS.  This database is implemented in the 
ArcSDE/Oracle environment on the District's HP-UX data server located in the Brooksville 
computer room.  The Mapping and GIS Section (MGIS) is the primary entity responsible for the 
entry and maintenance of most of the data in the GIS.  The Land Resources, Operations, and 
Records and Data Departments maintain specialized datasets within the GIS.  IRD and MGIS are 
jointly responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the GIS. 
2.5.3 Water Resource Data 
It is anticipated that data on ground and surface water levels, water quality, stream flows, and 
climatological trends will be used in this system.  The source for these data is the Water 
Management Database (WMDB).  This database is implemented in the IBM DB2 environment 
on the District's IBM mainframe data server located in the Tampa Data Center.  The Operations 
Department is the primary entity responsible for the entry and maintenance of the water 
levels/flows and meteorological data in the RDB.  Water quality data stored in the WMDB are 
collected by multiple departments, processed by the District's laboratory, and loaded into the 
WMDB.  It is important to note that while almost all water level information collected by the 
District is entered into the WMDB, loading of water quality data is less common.  The WMDB, 
therefore, does not provide a comprehensive collection of water quality data. The Information 
Resources Department (IRD) is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the 
WMDB. 
2.5.4 GIS/RDB/WMDB Data Integration 
The proposed system will require the integration of data in the GIS, RDB, and WMDB.  Data in 
these systems are logically linked using a common identifier known as the Universal ID (UID).  
Each WUP withdrawal point and data collection site is assigned a UID.  UIDs are unique for 
physical objects such as wells, rain gauges, and stream gauges.  Unique UIDs are also assigned 
to surface water quality sample sites.  In cases where a well is both associated with a WUP and 
also serves as a data collection site, it is assigned a single UID that provides linkages to data 
stored in both the RDB and WMDB.  In the GIS, the UID is associated with a physical location 
and, therefore, can be represented within a data layer representing WUPs, stream gauges, or 
rainfall stations. 
 
Data are physically transferred from the DB2-based WMDB and RDB to the ArcSDE/Oracle 
based GIS using the Transformation Server software.  This software provides tools for moving 
data between databases in their entirety or as selected subsets.  While this transfer is currently 
only done from the WMDB/RDB to the GIS, it is technically possible to transfer data in the other 
direction. 
2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies 
Requirements have surfaced that require data that is currently not available, either not collected 
or not stored in one of the databases (e.g., relocated quantities, lapsed quantities, etc.).  It is 
assumed that the needed changes, to collect and store the data, will be made within the current 
application and database.  These changes would need to be implemented on the mainframe and it 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project – 
February 13, 2007 
Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
8
is assumed this would not be within the scope of this project.  However, if the required changes 
cannot be completed to the current systems in a timely manner, the WUT System will need to 
implement these requirements within the new application. 
 
It is also assumed that the current databases mentioned above are still available in their current 
form during the development of the WUT System.  The WUT System will be dependent on the 
data stored in the WUP, WMDB, GIS, and RDB databases.  Changes to the current systems 
would need to be done in collaboration with the WUT Project Development Team.  
Communication between the responsible parties is key in the success of the development of this 
system. 
 
One requirement for the WUT System is that it will be developed with the hardware and 
software architecture currently in place at the District.  Changes to the current architecture 
requirements could have a negative impact on the development of this system and cause delays 
in the release of the system. 
2.7 Needs 
The following is a list of needs that were captured in the SWUCA Permitted Water Use Tracking 
Application – Feasibility Study.  These needs and the requirements gathered at the Requirements 
Workshops will be consolidated and presented to the Stakeholders at the Requirements Summary 
Workshop for discussion and prioritization. 
 
 Needs: 
• Depict geographic and temporal trends in permitted and/or actual pumpage within the 
SWUCA 
• "Cradle to grave" tracking and analysis of individual ground and surface water withdrawal 
points 
• Identification of sources for withdrawal points (surface versus ground, aquifer, status, 
alternative sources, etc.) 
• Monitoring changes in permitted and actual pumping 
• Tracking changes in predominant use types 
• Tracking changes in permit ownership 
• Identifying withdrawal points with lapsed permitted quantities.  As used here, lapsed 
quantities refer to any reductions in permitted pumpage for a particular well.  These may be 
the result of expiration of a permit, purchase of land that leads to retiring of a WUP, changes 
in predominant use type, plugging of well, or any other event that leads to a reduction in the 
permitted withdrawal from that point. 
• Aggregate permitted pumpage, actual use, and lapsed quantities for defined geographic areas 
• Must be able to analyze the impacts of alternative supplies on pumpage in a particular 
geographic area

3 Requirements Gathering Process 
By following the RUP process, the WUT Project Development Team is executing a software 
development approach that is iterative, architecture-centric, and use-case driven.  Use cases are a 
very important artifact of the initial phase of the project.  The RUP outlines a process of how the 
development team goes from a vision of the system to be built, to specific requirements extracted 
from stakeholders, and, finally, to a use case model and use cases. 
3.1 Requirement Workshops and Summaries 
Requirement workshops were held in the initial weeks of the project to gather the user’s 
requirements to the system.  The stakeholders for the project are categorized into four categories:  
Executive Staff, Technical Staff, Science Business Staff, and Regulatory Staff.  Workshops were 
held for each of these groups with follow-up one-on-one interviews to clarify or refine 
requirements.  The agenda for each of these workshops was tailored to each of these groups.  For 
example, the Executive Staff meeting is more focused on the vision of the project.  The 
Technical Staff meeting is more focused on the technical requirements of the project.  The 
remaining two groups, mostly made up of the power-users of the system, concentrated on the 
actual requirements of the system.  An additional workshop was held to outline specific 
requirements needed for the system to support the SWUCA Recovery Plan.  A summary was 
produced for each of the workshops and distributed to the participants for review.  Feedback was 
received through the review process and the summaries were updated to reflect these comments. 
3.2 Requirements Traceability Matrix 
All the requirements gathered during the requirement workshops were reviewed and 
consolidated into the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).  The purpose of the WUT RTM 
is to document and manage the business and functional requirements for the WUT Project.  The 
WUT RTM provides a master list of business and functional requirements organized into a 
number of meaningful features, each of which is a set of logically related requirements.  Within 
the matrix, each requirement is mapped to one or more use cases within the WUT Use Case 
Model that supports the requirement.  Once all requirements are mapped to a use case, 
SWFWMD is guaranteed that all business and functional requirements will be supported by the 
WUT software system.  The WUT RTM also provides a means to scope the WUT Project for 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project – 
February 13, 2007 
Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
10
success by prioritizing the features and/or requirements associated with each feature across the 
various releases of the WUT System. 
 
For purposes of requirements management and traceability, the requestor(s) of each requirement 
is included in the matrix.  This allows the project development team to easily know whom to 
contact if questions or concerns arise during the development of the system regarding a certain 
requirement.  The capability to map these requirements increases the likelihood that upon the 
customer acceptance of a software solution that supports all the use cases within the Use Case 
Model, the project development team will have delivered a software product that fulfills the 
customer’s needs. 
 
As more detailed and precise information is learned about the water use permitting analysis and 
reporting business processes throughout the WUT Project life cycle, the WUT RTM will be 
updated to refine existing requirements statements and to capture new business and functional 
requirements as they are identified.  Keeping the WUT RTM updated is a critical success factor 
because it provides one of the primary mechanisms for measuring and ensuring the success of 
the WUT Project.  That is, the mapping of business and functional requirements to use cases 
ensures that these requirements drive the software engineering effort through design, 
implementation, and testing as a result of the use case realization process utilized by the WUT 
Project Development Team.  Once all the use cases within the WUT Use Case Model have been 
implemented, then all the business and functional requirements have been satisfied and the WUT 
Project will have completed successfully. 
3.3 Use Case Model and Use Cases 
The use case model primarily sets the functional requirements on the system, and is used as an 
essential input to analysis and architectural design.  In essence, the use case model and use cases 
are a contract between the project development team and the stakeholders with regards to the 
functionality of the system.  The initial release of the model in the inception phase is used to 
outline the scope of the system.  The use case model is refined by more detailed flows of events 
during the elaboration and construction phases.  The use case model is continuously kept 
consistent with the design model. 
 
The use case model consists of use case packages.  A use case package is a collection of use 
cases, actors, relationships, diagrams, and other packages.  It is used to structure the model by 
dividing it into smaller parts.  The WUT Use Case Model consists of two packages: 
• 
Maintain Water Use Tracking Information 
• 
View Water Use Permit Information 
 
The functionality of a system is defined by use cases, each of which represents a specific flow of 
events.  The description of a use case defines what happens in the system when the use case is 
performed.  All functional requirements must be able to be linked to at least one use case.  This 
ensures all required functionality is being included in the system to be built.  Use cases contain 
several key items: 
• Business Context – A description of the business need of the use case. 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project – 
February 13, 2007 
Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
11
• Pre-Conditions – A list of any conditions that must be met before the use case can be 
executed. 
• Flow of Events – The sequence of events that can take place during the execution of the use 
case.  This includes the Primary Flow, or basic path, Alternate Flows, Warning Flows, and 
Exception Flows. 
• Post-Conditions – A list of conditions that can be expected after the use cases ends, 
dependent on the flow of events executed. 
• Special Requirements – A list of any special requirements for a particular use case.  This is a 
“catch-all” section where any information regarding a use case can be captured and stored. 
 
The users and any other system that may interact with the system are the actors.  Because they 
represent system users, actors help delimit the system and give a clearer picture of what it is 
supposed to do.  Use cases are developed on the basis of the actors' needs.  This ensures that the 
system will turn out to be what the users expected. 
 
Also included in the use case model are the use case diagrams.  These diagrams illustrate the use 
cases and the actors and the interaction between the two.  Use case diagrams can also be 
organized by use case packages to show only what is relevant within a particular package. 
 
The WUT Use Case Model was created and is currently stored in the Enterprise Architect 
modeling tool.  The model includes all requirements gathered to-date for the project.  The model 
also has all use cases that will be developed for the WUT System.  All requirements are linked 
within the model to one or more use cases.  All the actors identified for the project are also in the 
model.  The use case diagrams show the interaction between the actors and the use cases. 
3.4 Supplementary Specification 
In contrast to business and functional requirements, non-functional requirements are system 
requirements that cannot be readily traced to specific use cases within the Use Case Model but 
are nonetheless critical to the overall success of the software project.  In general, there are two 
types of non-functional requirements, qualitative and general systems.  The first type of non-
functional requirements are actually constraints upon the various functions, tasks, or behaviors 
that constitute the system’s business and functional requirements and are, thus, commonly 
considered to be the qualitative aspects of the proposed software system. 
 
Qualitative systems requirements include considerations like: 
• Usability 
• Reliability 
• Performance 
• Supportability 
• Performance Measures 
 
The other type of non-functional requirements is general systems requirements typical to most 
software engineering projects.  No specific general systems requirements were gathered during 
the requirement workshops for the WUT Project.  However, these topics will be covered in the 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project – 
February 13, 2007 
Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
12
Software Architecture Document created during the Elaboration Phase of the project.  General 
systems requirements include considerations like: 
• Security 
• Relational Database Management System 
• Backup and Recovery and Disaster Recovery 
• User Documentation and Training 
 
Because non-functional requirements cannot be traced to specific use cases within the use case 
model or, in some cases like security, apply to all use cases within the use case model, these 
requirements are typically not documented in the Requirements Traceability Matrix.  Rather, 
non-functional requirements are documented and managed through a separate deliverable called 
a Supplementary Specification. 
 
The purpose of the WUT Supplementary Specification is to document and manage the non-
functional requirements, or the qualitative and general systems requirements that are not mapped 
to a specific use cases within the WUT Use Case Model.  These requirements were collected 
during the Requirement Workshops held during the Inception Phase of the project.  This 
Supplementary Specification will be managed and iteratively refined as appropriate throughout 
the life of the WUT Project. 
 
The Supplementary Specification will be a valuable aid to all members of the WUT Project 
Development Team.  This specification will be used as a communication medium between the 
development team and the Project Stakeholders with regards to both qualitative and general 
systems requirements.  The Development Team itself will use the supplementary specification as 
a reference when designing responsibilities, operations, and attributes on classes within the WUT 
Design Model, and when adjusting the classes within the model to the proposed implementation 
environment.  Finally, the supplementary specification will be used to verify compliance of the 
non-functional requirements during the testing of the WUT software.

4 WUT Requirements 
4.1 WUT Requirements Traceability Matrix 
The current version of the WUT RTM is organized into two sections: 
• Requirements for the Initial Release of the WUT System 
• Requirements Identified for a Possible Subsequent Release of the WUT System 
 
The first section identifies the set of business and functional requirements that will be supported 
in the initial release of the WUT System and the second section is comprised of the balance of 
the requirements that will be prioritized by the WUT Project Manager for a subsequent release of 
system.  Within each section, the requirements are organized into a number of features, each of 
which is a logically related set of requirements.  Within each feature, the requirements are 
documented and managed within a matrix or table comprised of the following columns: 
 
• Req ID – A unique identifier for each requirement 
• Requirement Statement – Individual WUT business and functional requirements expressed 
as a sentence that includes the word shall, will or must 
• Use Case – A unique name that identifies the WUT Use Case that supports the requirement

4.1.1.6 Minimum Flows and Levels 
Req ID 
Requirement Statement 
Use Case 
EW6 
Need a protocol to assess how the actual flow and 
levels (AFL) compare to the established minimum 
flows and levels (MFL), including general trending 
information and whether waterbody-specific criteria 
are being met.  There are 3 major provisions to track: 
• Minimum aquifer level - The saltwater intrusion 
MFL is met when the moving 10-year AFL is at or 
above the MFL for five consecutive years. The 
MFL is not met when the 10-year moving AFL in 
the reference wells is below the MFL for two 
consecutive years. 
• Minimum flows on the upper Peace River - The 
MFL is met when the MFL's are at or above the 
established MFL for three consecutive years. Once 
the MFL has been considered met, if it is followed 
by two years where the MFL is not met within a 
rolling ten-year period, then the AFL shall be 
considered below the MFL.  A determination of 
whether AFL's are meeting the established MFL is 
made at each one of the established minimums 
(Bartow, Ft. Meade and Zolfo Springs). 
• Minimum lake levels - The proposed MFL is 
achieved when the long-term P50 is at or above 
the MFL and the long-term P10 is at or above the 
High Minimum Lake Level for five consecutive 
years. Once in compliance, MFL is not met when 
the long-term P50 is below the MFL for two or 
more consecutive years or the long-term P10 is 
below the High Minimum Lake Levels for two or 
more consecutive years.

View Report 
SW19 
SR34 
Use system to publish a chart or graph that compares 
the MFL to a running average of AFL's.  This should 
reflect how the AFL's are moving along the MFL line 
and indicate how different resources impact the MFL.  
The resources to include are pumpage, new projects, 
and rainfall.  It will probably be run on a monthly 
basis.

Need tool to be able to estimate water use (now being done in SAS).  To do this 
estimate, you need to be able to query the water use data with various variables, 
such as time period, use types, withdrawal type (groundwater or surfacewater), and 
geographic areas.  Once the initial query is complete, you need to be able to refine 
the resulting data set.  An example is when you select active permits in a time 
period.  If a permit expired inside of the time period, the refine tool would help 
determine if that permit would or would not be a part of the result set, perhaps by 
determining at what point in the time line it expired.

4.2 WUT Use Case Model 
As explained above, the WUT Use Case Model has been created and is maintained within the 
Enterprise Architect modeling software.  For a detailed view of the model, the Enterprise 
Architect tool can be used to view such items as: 
• 
Requirements of the system and their relationships to use cases 
• 
All the actors that have been identified for the system 
• 
The use case packages used to organize the model 
• 
The use cases, organized by package.  
• 
The actors and their interaction with the use cases

The following sections will describe the various components of a use case model. 
4.2.1 Actors 
Over forty actors, with very specific job duties, were identified for the WUT System during a use 
case workshop.  All these actors were consolidated into more general categories.  Since a 
majority of the WUT System is reporting in nature, all the actors will have the ability to run 
reports, view maps, and query water use permits  (i.e., General WUT User).  Only a few of the 
features within the system involve the editing of data used by the system.  These features will 
only be available to a select few users (i.e., WUT Administrator, Water Use Estimator).  Figure 1 
shows all the actors that were identified during the workshops, the general categories of these 
actors, as well as three non-human actors (i.e., Data Integration System, Oracle Read Only 
Database, Regulatory Database). 
  
 
 
Figure 1 – WUT Actors 
4.2.2 Use Cases 
Identifying use cases in a use case model is only the critical first step.  The business processes 
identified by each use case in the use case model must be described in detail in a narrative 
document.  This narrative describes the behaviors the resulting software system must be designed 
to support.  However, following the iterative nature of RUP, not all use cases are fully completed 
during the initial phase of the project.  A selection of critical and architecturally significant use 
cases were identified to be completed during the initial phase of the project.  Figure 2 below 
shows the Use Case diagram illustrating all the use cases identified to-date for the WUT Project.

Although not all use cases will be fully realized during the initial release of the system, a 
Business Context has been created for every use case shown in the diagram in Figure 2.  The 
following sections contain these business contexts. 
4.2.2.1 Process WUT System Startup 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to access the Water Use Tracking (WUT) 
System, a browser-based, distributed 3-tier client/server application initially deployed on 
SWFWMD’s Intranet.  To access the WUT System, the actor will request the browser to display 
the WUT System Startup Page.  This startup page will display information (e.g., WUT System 
News) as well as provide access to the various features supported by the WUT System (e.g., 
View Water Use Permit information, performing spatial analysis using Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS) maps, or running a report).   
 
The information and features available to the actor will be controlled through the WUT System 
role-based security and WUT System Roles and their associated privileges.  When the actor 
initially requests access, the WUT System will determine the actor’s role and this will, in turn, 
determine the features available to the actor.  Any actor not explicitly assigned to a WUT System 
Access Criteria role (i.e., WUT Admin User, WUT Manager User) will, by default, be assigned 
to the WUT System General User Role.  This general role will be allowed to access all features 
that are not restricted to a specific WUT user role. 
4.2.2.2 Generate Well Package 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to generate a well package file for import into 
Groundwater Vistas to model the impact of well/withdrawal changes.  The well package is a 
comma-delimited file that contains many attributes, including location information, regarding 
water withdrawal wells within the District.  The well package is used as input into in the creation 
of the District-wide Regulatory Model, as well as in the creation of regional models. 
4.2.2.3 Maintain Business Rule Parameters 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to update business rule parameters within the 
WUT System.  Generally, these parameters are used in making specific calculations within the 
system.  For example, information in the SWUCA II rules explicitly defines how a Lapsed 
Quantity or Water Withdrawal Credits are calculated.  Any parameter that could be used in a 
calculation could be maintained using this use case.  It is important to note that these parameters 
will not be used to change the original information stored in the database, but would be used to 
create "derived" data to be shown within reports or on the screen. 
4.2.2.4 Maintain Quick Links 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to manage the quick links located on the WUT 
Home Page.  These are links to other websites that could be helpful to a WUT user.  For 
example, a link to other water district's websites to possibly view water use permit information 
could helpful.  If a permit is requested near the boundary of the District, the ability to view data 
from the adjacent District would be helpful in determining the impacts of the new permit.

4.2.2.5 Maintain Water Use Estimates 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to maintain water use estimation values for water 
use permits.  The permitted quantity is known for all water use permits.  However, the actual 
pumpage is only known for those permittees that submit their data.  For those permits that do not 
submit pumpage data, their water use is estimated, based on the data that is submitted from other 
wells.  Currently, the water use estimates are stored in Excel spreadsheets and SAS datasets.  
Currently, this data can only be viewed in summarized form in the Water Use Estimates 
document published annually.  This use case will allow the actor to import water use estimate 
data for each water use permit into a database table that can be used by the WUT System.  This 
will allow users of the system to view pumpage data, as an estimated value, even for permittees 
that do not submit their pumpage information. 
4.2.2.6 Maintain WUT News 
This use case is used when the actor needs to maintain WUT news items for communication to 
users when they access the WUT Home Page.  For example, the system administrator may need 
to inform WUT users that the system will be down for maintenance over the weekend.  Using 
this feature, the system administrator can create a system maintenance news item for display 
starting and ending on specified dates.  Displaying news on the WUT Home Page ensures that all 
users will have access to this important information when they first access the application.   
4.2.2.7 Process Database Replication 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to replicate and normalize (restructure) data that 
has been copied directly from a DB2 database on the IBM mainframe to a read-only Oracle 
database.  The current data structure was implemented to support a data entry system and not for 
the use in a decision support reporting system.  The data is being restructured to take advantage 
of the strengths of a relational database management system.  After the initial replication of the 
DB2 tables, nightly updates are made to the Oracle tables with the data that has changed since 
the previous replication process.  By normalizing the data into relational tables, it will allow the 
data to be more accessible using ad-hoc query tools. 
4.2.2.8 View Change in Use Type or Owner 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view information about the relocation of 
permitted quantities associated with a specific water use permit.  When an application is made to 
relocate permitted quantities and change the use type or owner of an existing permitted quantity 
that impacts an MFL waterbody that is below its minimum level, the application is subject to 
certain criteria.  The previously permitted quantity is first reviewed under the reasonable 
beneficial use test.  The quantity available for the new owner or new use type is limited to 90 
percent of the permitted historically used portion of the reasonable-beneficial quantity, not 
including any Drought Credit quantities.  This 10 percent reduction in historically used permitted 
reasonable-beneficial quantity impacting the MFL waterbodies constitutes a Net Benefit. 
 
If any reasonable beneficial, historically unused quantities will remain on the source permit, 
these quantities are also reduced by the Net Benefit provision (i.e., 10 percent) and are available 
only for the existing use type at the source permit site.  If any reasonable-beneficial, historically 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project –

30
used quantities will remain on the source permit, these quantities are not subject to the Net 
Benefit provisions and may be used for the existing use type.  Any future application to modify 
the use type or owner, or to relocate with a change in use type or owner, these remaining 
reasonable-beneficial, historically used quantities will be subject to the Net Benefit provisions.  
Any historically unused quantities remaining at the source permit site may not be relocated in the 
future and may not have a change in use type. 
 
The following information will be displayed pertaining to the relocation of a WUP: 
• Historical used quantity 
• Historical unused quantity 
• Reasonable beneficial quantity 
• The WUP that the relocated amount came from 
• The WUP that the relocated amount went to 
• The dates that any of these values took affect or changed 
4.2.2.9 View Compliance Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view Compliance data associated with a 
specific water use permit.  Depending on the data submitted by the permittee, compliance data 
could include pumpage quantities, meter readings, crop reports, well construction specifications, 
and any other condition data associated with a water use permit.  Providing compliance 
information will give District staff time-saving devices with which they can better monitor the 
enforcement activities of the District, with minimal impact to staff time.  Better access to those 
who are not submitting pumpage information will help evaluators better determine the site 
conditions while evaluating the impacts of new applications in the same area. 
4.2.2.10 View Crop Report Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view crop report data associated with a 
specific permit.  Crop report data is collected on an annual or semi-annual basis and is submitted 
by the permittee.  A different form is submitted for recreational use, annual crops, and seasonal 
crops.  It contains the crop or use type, acreage for each use, predominate soil type, and planting 
dates.  The data submitted with crop reports, in many cases, is not audited for accuracy, and is 
often incomplete or inaccurate.  The primary purposes of this form are to verify the actual soil 
type for the location so that more accurate water allocations can be made, link the actual ground 
conditions to the use information in the database, and monitor the use of water conserving 
credits. 
4.2.2.11 View Land Use Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view land use data associated with a specific 
water use permit.  Possible scenarios include viewing trends for specified areas or determining 
how water use changed as land use changes.   
 
Land use data can be collected during permit submittal or as conditions set on a permit, as well 
as from map analysis.  Permittees will supply land use information as water use code types or 
from crop reports submitted for certain WUPs.  Map analysis is conducted from the land use

layer derived from Florida's land use cover classification system (FLUCCS), color infrared (CIR) 
digital orthophoto quarter quadrangles (DOQQs), or other aerial photography. 
4.2.2.12 View Lapsed or Project Quantities Summary 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view lapsed or project quantities data 
associated with a specific water use permit.  With the implementation of the new SWUCA rules, 
this process will allow the actor to track these quantities. 
 
Most of the land within the SWUCA is associated with an existing water use permit.  Over time, 
permits are reduced, abandoned due to land use changes or abandonment of an activity, retired 
due to acquisition of land for preservation purposes, or by other means.  Historically, this permit 
activity has resulted in an overall reduction in water use.  Now, however, these lapsed quantities 
will be available for new and expanding water users to meet their needs.  Another way for a 
water use permit applicant to get water that meets their needs is by the use of quantities that are 
associated with District projects. 
4.2.2.13 View Map 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view water use permit (WUP) information 
spatially using a map created with the functionality provided by a Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS).  Viewing WUP information in a pre-defined report format can be very effective 
from the point of view of efficiency, organization, and the presentation of large amounts of data.  
Even so, a report is simply a one-dimensional presentation of information when that information 
has at its basis a spatial context.  When viewing WUP information in a report, the subtlety and 
complexity of the spatial relationships cannot be presented at all or is, at best, difficult to 
comprehend.   The viewing of information within its spatial context is exactly where GIS excels 
and is the primary reason for this View Map Use Case.  When additional GIS layers are added to 
a map, the multi-dimensional presentation of information provides for a richness of analysis 
simply not possible using a report format. 
 
Although not intended exclusively for this actor, one of the primary actors who will use this use 
case is the WUP Evaluators.  They are responsible for the analysis of all new, modified, and 
renewed WUPs.  During the analysis process, the evaluator will frequently require access to a 
map to view WUP data within its spatial context.  Doing so will enable the evaluator to view 
other important data within the area of interest resulting in a far richer analytical effort.  By 
having the ability to add different GIS layers to the map, the evaluator will have more 
information at their disposal to assist in their analytical effort.  Add to this the capability to pan, 
zoom, and print at any time, the evaluator will have all the information and functionality required 
to make better, more informed decisions. 
4.2.2.14 View Mitigation of MFL Impacts 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view information of how a specific water use 
permit has mitigated its impact on a MFL waterbody.  When an applicant demonstrates 
compliance with all conditions for issuance, except that it impacts a minimum flow or level 
waterbody, the applicant can apply for a permit if they provide a Net Benefit to the impacted 
MFL waterbody.  This mitigation strategy could include the proposition of a water resource

development project that more than negates their proposed impact or it could be the purchasing 
of adjacent land with water use permits for their own use. 
 
The following information will be displayed to show the mitigation of MFL impacts: 
• The permits and their quantities that were bought out to mitigate the MFL impact 
• The District’s projects and their quantities used to mitigate the MFL impact 
• The self-funded projects and their quantities used to mitigate the MFL impact 
4.2.2.15 View Net Benefit Summary 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to analyze Net Benefit data associated with a 
specific water use permit.  With the implementation of the new SWUCA rules, this process will 
allow the actor to track the Net Benefits.  A Net Benefit is obtained when the proposed 
withdrawal, coupled with other activities or measures, will result in an improvement to the MFL 
waterbody that more than offsets the impact of the withdrawal.  In all Net Benefit options, 
reasonable beneficial use plays a key part.  Permits are granted based upon meeting numerous 
rule criteria including that the quantities requested are fully needed for the proposed use, or 
existing use in case of a renewal. 
 
The applicant for a new permit or for a modification or renewal of an existing permit is required 
to file detailed information to demonstrate and justify to the reasonable satisfaction of the 
District the reasonable beneficial quantities intended to be used during the term of the proposed 
permit before it will be issued.  This requirement is intended to assist the District in seeking to 
reduce the difference between permitted quantities and used quantities.  For those cases in which 
an applicant is seeking a modification or renewal of an existing permit, the District will consider 
historical use, metered pumping data, trends and patterns of usage, actual type of usage, and 
other relevant factors. 
 
A Net Benefit can be obtained in several ways including: 
• Relocation with a change in use type or owner 
• Water withdrawal credits 
• Mitigation of minimum flow and level impacts 
 
There are several ways that the District is going to gain water with the new SWUCA rules, from 
reclaimed water lines, lapsed quantities, water withdrawal credits, and the relocations rules. 
4.2.2.16 View Report 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to produce a report from within the WUT Report 
Library.  It is anticipated that the WUT System will have a large number of reports available in 
its report library.  Every report use case within the WUT Report Library will extend this use case 
as appropriate for the specific report. 
 
A report in this library provides information in a pre-defined format.  While the information 
content of the report is pre-defined, the system enhances the flexibility of the report by providing 
the actor with the capability to optionally limit the information in any given report to the actor’s 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project –

33
specific area of interest (e.g., a specific county).  This is accomplished through report 
specifications.  While a given report may be run frequently, the information content will often 
vary from report to report based upon the run-time report specifications given by the actor.  
 
This use case provides support for the numerous reports within the WUT Report Library.  Once 
the actor specifies the report of interest and optionally supplies any run-time report criteria, the 
system will retrieve the information for the actor and present it in the pre-defined format.  The 
actor can then choose to simply view the report online or download the report for analysis, 
printing, or saving as an electronic file in a variety of supported formats. 
4.2.2.17 View Resource Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view water resource data associated with a 
specific water use permit.  The water resource data is collected by the permittee, and varies 
depending on the requirements of the permit including water quality data, water flows and levels, 
total dissolved mineral levels (TDML), and rainfall amounts. 
4.2.2.18 View Use of Lapsed Quantities 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view the use of lapsed quantities associated 
with a specific water use permit. Historically, reduced, abandoned, and retired permits have 
resulted in an overall reduction in water use.  But now, these quantities will be a primary means 
for many new or expanding water users to meet their needs.  Where an applicant demonstrates 
compliance with all conditions for issuance, except that it impacts an MFL waterbody, the 
applicant can apply for up to 90% of the water it has identified as historically used by a water use 
permit holder that has permanently discontinued their use and abandoned their permit.  The 
applicant must also demonstrate that other Net Benefit options, including relocation, mitigation, 
participation in a District Source Augmentation Project, are not feasible.  This Net Benefit 
provision applies only when the previous water use was derived from a source where the 
permanently discontinued use had a similar or greater effect on the impacted MFL waterbody as 
the proposed use. 
 
One of the main goals of the WUT System is to track changes in permitted and used quantities so 
that historically used, reasonable beneficial quantities potentially available from reduced, 
abandoned, or retired permits and their relation to MFL waterbodies will be known for potential 
applicants and for District decision making.  Quantities of water retired from land acquisition 
programs are included for use as lapsed quantities unless the acquiring agency specifically 
requests for them to be excluded from use.  
 
The following information will be displayed pertaining to lapsed quantities associated with 
reduced, abandoned, and retired permits: 
• The quantities a retired WUP has contributed to another WUP 
• The quantities a WUP has received from a retired WUP 
• The retired WUP that a lapsed quantity came from 
• The quantities from the retired WUP available as lapsed quantities 
• The WUP that a lapsed quantity went to

• Whether a WUPs quantity has been excluded from the lapsed quantity pool as a result of a 
land acquisition program 
• The dates that any of these values took affect or changed 
4.2.2.19 View Use of Quantities Associated With District Projects 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view the quantities used from District Source 
Augmentation Projects associated with a specific water use permit.  Where applicants 
demonstrate compliance with all conditions for issuance except that it impacts an MFL 
waterbody, the applicant can apply for the source augmentation accomplished through a District 
water resource development project, provided that the source of supply is the same source being 
augmented. 
4.2.2.20 View Water Use Permit 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view information about a specific water use 
permit.  This water use permit information is collected at the time the permit is submitted and 
approved by the District.  A water use permit is required from the District when:  
 
• Total capacity of the permit is greater than or equal to 1 million gallons per day 
• Total annual average quantities for the permit is greater than or equal to 100,000 gallons per 
day 
• Well diameter is greater than or equal to 6 inches 
• Surface water withdrawal pipe diameters are greater than or equal to 4 inches 
• Cumulative well diameters greater than or equal to 6 inches, if in MIA and constructed after 
April 11, 1994, and is not a replacement well of same or smaller diameter of one being 
plugged 
• If withdrawal is likely to cause significant adverse impacts to existing water or land uses, or 
the surrounding water resources 
 
The actual area of the permit is digitized as a polygon into a GIS layer based on color infrared 
(CIR) digital orthophoto quarter quadrangles (DOQQs).  The general data that is collected with 
the permit includes the permittee information, acreage amounts, permitted quantities, water use 
information, expiration date, and aquifer information.  This information will be displayed to the 
actor, with the option to "drill-down" to get more detailed information, such as well information 
or actual pumpage quantities. 
4.2.2.21 View Water Use Permit Search 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to search for and identify a water use permit for 
analysis.  This use case, as well as the View Map Use Case, is considered among the class of 
Find use cases.  A Find use case provides the capability to identify, locate, and access 
information within the WUT System, as it pertains to a water use permit.  The View Water Use 
Permit Search use case enables the actor to efficiently and effectively search for and identify 
permits that meet a given search criteria.  The system returns basic information about the permit 
with the ability to get more detailed information regarding the permit (i.e., wells, Net Benefits, 
compliance data).  This use case is used in support of the View Water Use Permit Use Case.

4.2.2.22 View Water Withdrawal Credit 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view water withdrawal credit information 
associated with a specific water use permit.  A water withdrawal credit is an incentive for an 
applicant to provide other water use permit holders with alternative supplies.  The holder of the 
credits can use them to provide a Net Benefit in order to obtain water from an MFL waterbody 
because the overall impact will be an improvement.  The applicant (Supplier) provides an 
alternative supply to offset actual withdrawals from an existing permit holder (Receiver).  The 
credit is 50% of the offset amount.  The discontinued quantities are placed in a standby permit 
and are given back to the Receiver in the event the Supplier ever stops providing the alternative 
source, essentially giving the Receiver their original quantity back. 
 
The following information will be displayed pertaining to the water withdrawal credits for a 
WUP: 
• The offset quantity coming from an alternative source 
• Where the alternative source coming from 
• The Supplier of the alternative source 
• The Receiver of the alternative source 
• The distribution of the credit (50% of the offset) between the Supplier and Receiver 
• The discontinued quantities to be stored in a standby permit 
• The dates that any of these values took affect or changed 
4.2.2.23 View Well Construction Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view well construction information that is 
associated with a specific water use permit.  Well construction information is gathered during the 
construction and permitting of the wells.  This information includes well depth, casing depth, 
well diameter, status code, drilling method, and completion date.  When a well also requires a 
Water Use Permit, some of this information is entered in both the Well Construction database 
and the Water Use Permit Well database.  The two tables are loosely linked.  When the Water 
Use Permit and well number are entered into the Well Construction database, a link is created to 
that permit in the Water Use Permit Well database.  The actual information in the table is not 
updated, but another page of well construction information (well construction number, 
completion date, diameter, total and case depth, and well status) is available to view, but only on 
the specified revision.  The well completion information in the Well Construction database is 
considered to supersede the WUP Well information, which can contain estimated data.  Depth 
information is important in determining what aquifer a well is pumping water from so the 
drawdown impacts for new water use can be calculated accurately. 
4.2.2.24 View Withdrawal Pumpage Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view withdrawal pumpage information 
associated with a specific water use permit.  Pumpage data is collected at certain wells and 
estimated for others based on several categories of water and land use.  Most pumpage data is 
collected on a monthly basis, either through a permittee submittal or a utility company meter 
reading.  Based on these actual values, other wells that are not metered can be estimated.  
Permittees submit their readings by mail, e-mail, or the Internet.  The older permits are required

to submit actual pumpage values, while new permits submit the meter readings that are then used 
to calculate the actual pumpage amount.
