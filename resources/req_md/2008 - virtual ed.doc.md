   Introduction


1 Purpose


This highly detailed Software Requirements Specification document explains
and describes all of the agreed upon requirements that will be implemented
for the VIRTUAL-EDU system, designed for NJIT. The document will provide
the underlining structure of VIRTUAL-EDU, in a manner that both the
Developers and the Customer will have a clear understanding of its
functions, interface, design and constraints. Once the documents are
approved by NJIT, it will also serve as a contract between the developers
and NJIT.


This document is intended to be read and utilized by the development team
of VIRTUAL-EDU, including testers, programmers and project managers, the
administrators of NJIT and any stockholder interested in seeing what NJIT
is bringing forth to the university.


2 Document Conventions


The outline of this document will follow the table of contents found on the
second page of this document.


The outline is split into 6 sections.


      Section 1 - Description of the purpose of the document and what it
      will contain.


      Section 2 - Overall description of the project


      Section 3 - Highly detailed description of the system functional
      requirements


      Section 4 - External interface requirements that affect the system


      Section 5 - Insight on other non-functional requirements


      Section 6 - Glossary and DFD model diagrams of entire system


Each section is written with the intent that different users will read
different sections.  The first two sections use universal language; while
the next four sections use technical language.


The requirements will be explained by their level of importance.
Meaningful requirements will be describe first and less meaningful
requirements will be describe last.  Every requirement will be mentioned
and explained with the same high level of detail.





The majority of the models showcased in this document will consist of data-
flow diagram (DFD’s)


3 Project Scope


The project being developed for NJIT goes by the name of VIRTUAL-EDU. The
requirements specified on this S.R.S. document coincide with the
university’s  need for a new distance learning system which will enable
professors to communicate more effectively with students via a Secure
Application Platform that provides at the very least the following features
(email, group chat, bulletin board, and audio/visual tools).  The proposed
system will incorporate robust features such as audio and video
capabilities, in which students within the same group or university can
communicate via a portal that provides both visual & audio functionality,
file hosting and file management, user profiles with pictures, better group
collaboration tools, and online testing capabilities.


The document will satisfy our project scope by delivering well documented
specifications, along with highly detailed models. Furthermore, it will
contain comprehensive explanations of the functionality and constraints of
each of the following requirements.


    ▪ Audio and video streaming capability/ podcasting (live and on-
      demand)


    ▪ File hosting and file management tools


    ▪ User profiles with pictures including integration with other campus
      resources


    ▪ Chat and group collaboration tools (Instant messaging)


    ▪ Online testing tools with instant grading

   Overall Description


1 Product Perspective


Virtual-EDU consists of an online website that allows users to create a
classroom like environment with the features that it contains. Once
registered to the system, a user can create a profile sharing his or her
information with the rest of the enrolled users. Users will be able to find
commonalities with each other through the user profile. Virtual-EDU also
gives users the ability to store data and/or important materials in a
secure network location for future retrieval or present usage. This
particular data as well as other files may be shared or worked on using
Virtual-EDU extensive tools for file sharing and document collaboration.
Users can work together on a single document in real time or send their
work to other users via secure file sharing methods and protocols. If
further communication is need between users, Virtual-EDU has features such
as instant messaging, where users can hold single or group conversations
via a secure real-time communication based on typed text. However, if more
efficient means of communication are need, users have the ability to hold
single or group video/audio conferences, whereby the users will be able to
see other users streamed live in real-time.


The top level diagram below shows all of the user features that will be
implemented for the system.

2 Product Features


    ▪ Streaming audio and video (both live and on-demand) will allow users
      to interact with faculty and fellow classmates over a streaming video
      and audio, one-to-one or one-to-many connection. Also, learning
      materials can be delivered through audio and video formats.


    ▪ The instant messaging feature will allow users to interact with
      faculty and fellow classmates via text-based format, one-to-one or one-
      to-many connection.


    ▪ File sharing and document collaboration tools allow users to
      efficiently share and develop documents and reports within a group.


    ▪ User profiles containing contact information, pictures, and other
      related information on a student personal page.  This page will only
      be accessible to students and faculty enrolled in the same class. Only
      the owner of the profile may make changes to it.


    ▪ Users will have the ability to manage a private temporary hosting
      space. Tools such as file uploading, directory creator, move, delete
      and rename will be accessible.


3 User Classes and Characteristics


System Administrators: User class with domain system privileges which
allows them to maintain the entire system, manage enrollment and create
virtual classes. Users in this class have complete control and knowledge of
the entire system.


Administrative End User: User class with domain class privileges, which
allows them to maintain and support the class they are enrolled in, along
with the other enrolled users. Users in this class have zero knowledge of
the back end of the system; however, they know the front end of the
application.


Limited End User: User class with limited class privileges, which allows
them to operate the front end of the system with limited read only
permissions. Users in this class will only be able to make modifications to
their profile section.


4 Operating Environment


     System Requirements - Hardware:


         ▪ Platform: at least Microsoft Server 2003


         ▪ CPU: at least Dual Core 3.6 MHz


         ▪ Space:  Minimum of 2 gigabytes


         ▪ Ram: Minimum of 4 gigabytes


     System Requirements - Software


         ▪ Web Service: Apache server


         ▪ Other services: IIS 6.0 or later, .Net Framework 2.0 or later,
           video and audio streaming.


     User Requirements – Hardware:


         ▪ CPU: at least 500 MHz


         ▪ Ram: at least 512 MB


         ▪ Recommended Peripherals:  microphones, web camera, video and
           audio cards.


     User Requirements – Software


         ▪ Browser:  Microsoft’s Internet Explorer or Apple’s Safari, or
           Mozilla’s Firefox.


         ▪ Services: SSH client, FTP client, VPN client


5 Design and Implementation Constraints


    ▪ The university will be in session during the development of the
      application. Since current system downtime needs to be maintained at
      low levels; system rollouts and system validation need to be scheduled
      during low usage periods.


    ▪ The current NJIT user database system required to run this
      application may be outdated or in need of maintenance. Therefore the
      current system may only house 250 concurrent users.


    ▪ Not allow languages will be represented for online system
      documentation.


    ▪ Only browsers from Microsoft, Apple and Mozilla will have functional
      access to the application.


6 User Documentation


Both the enrolled students and faculty will be provided with printable
manuals through email and will have access to on-line tutorials.  The
system will also provide an on-line help feature, providing the users with
easy to read “how-to” instructions. NJIT’s administration will be given an
in-depth manual of the entire system, so that they may support the system
after development is complete.


7 Assumptions and Dependencies


1 Current systems and databases will still be available for use and
      archive.


2 Database will be modified to meet VIRTUAL-EDU‘s requirements. New
      entities and relationships for the user will need to be added.


3 Staff is willing to accept, learn, and utilize the new system.


4 Users should have an adequate computer, network connection, and webcam
      with microphone.


5 Users will have access to common programs, such as media players for
      streaming.


   System Features


1 Instant Messaging


1 Description and Priority


Instant Messaging is the feature allowing students and professors to
interact with each other and talk in real time. Instead of leaving each
other messages on boards and going to chat rooms where screens are not
refreshed in less than 60 sec, students will be able to see who is online
and talk to them immediately. If a professor is marked online, students
will be able to ask questions and receive answers from the professor almost
instantaneously. This feature is of High Priority and students will be able
to benefit from this feature because it will give them the feeling of a
real classroom, something that most students are complaining lacks when
taking an online class.

4 Virtual-Space


1 Description and Priority


Virtual-Space consists of folder space set aside for each student to upload
files to.  An uploading feature would be the only component available in
the first release, which would aid in handing in assignments.  This feature
is of medium priority as email can still be used as a means for this type
of document sharing.  The cost of implementing this feature would include
insuring each class section a space on an FTP server.


2 Stimulus/Response Sequences

      User action: A user clicks the Upload button


      Response:  Should upload the selected file and produce a window
      letting the user know if the upload was successful.  If no file is
      selected, a window should let the user know they need to use the
      Browse button to select a file.  If the upload will cause the account
      to go over disk space quota, the file should be still be allowed and
      an email sent to the administrator and professor letting them know of
      the overage.  The file tree diagram should update with the new file
      name added to the list.


3 Functional Requirements


    ▪ Virtual-Space Req 1:  FTP management software on the server setup
      with quota space, user authentication, and appropriate user rights.


     a. For the first release, each class needs a quota space of at least
        1GB per student in that class.  If the upload will cause the
        account to go over disk space quota, the file should be still be
        allowed to upload and an email sent to the administrator and
        professor.


     b. Files causing the quota to be exceeded should not be allowed to
        upload.


     c. The students overall login should allow them access to the
        appropriate folder, and their account should only have Write
        privileges.


     d. The professor’s username should allow them access to the
        appropriate folder and have Read, Write, and Delete privileges.


     e. Firewall ports may need to be unblocked on both sides to

5 Virtual-Space V2


1 Description and Priority


In the second release of Virtual-ED’s Virtual-Space features would be added
to include full file management for any uploaded files.  In this release,
FTP space would be designated by student rather than by class section.
Disk space quotas would need to be implemented to preserve resources.  Each
student would be able to upload files to share with team members or to turn
in assignments.  Arranging by folders and deleting files would also be
newly added capabilities.


This would incur a higher cost to accommodate more disk space, and would
also require an administrator to spend more time managing the FTP accounts.
 The first release version of this feature was of medium priority, so
adding more capabilities to it would be of low priority as email is still a
highly usable alternative.
