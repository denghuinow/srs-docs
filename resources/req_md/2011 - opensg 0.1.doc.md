Introduction



1 Purpose



2 Scope







3 Acronyms and Abbreviations

This subsection provides a list of all acronyms and abbreviations required
to properly interpret the Enterprise Information Management System
Requirements Specification.

|EIM     |Enterprise Information Management        |
|SRS     |System Requirements Specification        |


4 External Considerations and References

The work of EIM SRS is dependent upon the best practices available from the
following entities and standards organizations:

 • The Open Group, TOGAF 9.0



5 Document Overview

TOGAF 9.0 defines four architecture domains that are commonly accepted as
subsets of overall enterprise architecture, all of which TOGAF is designed
to support, see Figure 1:
 • Architecture Vision defines overall architecture guiding principles,
   goals and objectives and desired traits.
 • The Business Architecture defines the business strategy, governance,
   organization, and key business processes.
 • The Data Architecture describes the structure of an organization's
   logical and physical data assets and data management resources.  This is
   part of the Information Systems Architecture.
 • The Application Architecture provides a blueprint for the individual
   application systems to be deployed, their interactions, and their
   relationships to the core business processes of the organization. This is
   part of the Information Systems Architecture.
 • The Technology Architecture describes the logical software and hardware
   capabilities that are required to support the deployment of business,
   data, and application services. This includes IT infrastructure,
   middleware, networks, communications, processing, standards, etc.

    Figure 1.  The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) showing the
                       architecture development cycle.


As such, the document will be structured as follows:

Section 2 describes the problem statement and what issues can be resolved
through the use of an EIM strategy.


Section 3 describes the overall Architecture Vision for the system,
including Guiding Principles, Framework, and the EIM Reference Model, all
relevant to providing a consistent framework within which the four
architecture components can be developed.

Section 4 provides the details of the four architecture components:
   1. Business Architecture:  This will refer to work products produced by
      the Use Case and Service Definition Teams of EIM, which includes the
      list of use cases and integration requirements and business services
      at the functional level.
   2. Application Architecture: This provides the technical level
      requirements relative to how applications are modeled as logical
      components, and what services each logical components may provide or
      consume. This should be an instantiation of the business services
      identified within the Business Architecture.
   3. Data Architecture:  This provides the technical level requirements
      relative to how the EIM data should be modeled and represented
      consistently across all integration services to ensure semantic
      interoperability.
   4. Technology Architecture: This provides the technical level
      requirements relative to how services will interact with each other to
      support end-to-end EIM business processes.

Section 5 contains the considerations for an EIM Competency Center which
includes topics such as governance and knowledge distribution.

Problem Statement

What are the challenges that organizations are seeking to address through
the deployment of an EIM strategy?

5 Role of Information Security in EIM

Information security plays a central role in the enterprise information
management framework.  As such the Task Force has made a conscious decision
not to create a separate section addressing information security.  Instead,
security will be addressed and its impact will be identified in each of the
subsequent sections of this document.  In this manner, the System
Requirements Specification shall address securing the data artifacts and
the processes supporting the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of
information objects.
