Types of Requirements 
 
Definition 
A requirement is defined as "a condition or capability to which a system must 
conform". 
Functional requirements specify actions that a system must be able to perform, 
without taking physical constraints into consideration. These are often best described 
in a use-case model and in use cases. Functional requirements thus specify the input 
and output behaviour of a system. 
Requirements that are not functional are sometimes called non-functional 
requirements. Many requirements are non-functional, and describe only attributes 
of the system or attributes of the system environment.  
 
FURPS+ 
There are a many different kinds of requirements. One way of categorizing them is 
described as the FURPS+ model [GRA92], using the acronym FURPS to describe 
the major categories of requirements with subcategories as shown below.  
 Functionality,  
 Usability,  
 Reliability,  
 Performance and  
 Supportability  
 
The "+" in FURPS+ helps you to also remember to also include such requirements as 
 design constraints,  
 interface requirements and  
 physical requirements. 
 
Functionality 
(FUN) 
Functional requirements may include: 
 feature sets,  
 capabilities, and  
 security.

Types of Requirements, Continued 
 
Usability (USA) 
Usability requirements may include such sub-categories as:  
 human factors, 
 aesthetics,  
 consistency in the user interface,   
 online and context-sensitive help,  
 wizards and agents,  
 user documentation, and   
 training materials. 
 
Reliability 
(REL) 
Reliability requirements to be considered are:  
 Availability (percentage of time available, hours of use, maintenance access,…) 
 frequency / severity of failure,  
 recoverability,  
 predictability,  
 accuracy, and  
 mean time between failure (MTBF). 
 
Performance 
(PER) 
A performance requirement imposes conditions on functional requirements. For 
example, for a given action, it may specify performance parameters for:  
 throughput (e.g. transactions per second),  
 response time,  
 recovery time, or  
 resource usage (memory, disk, cpu,…).

Types of Requirements, Continued 
 
Supportability 
(SUP) 
Supportability requirements may include:  
 testability,  
 extensibility,  
 adaptability,  
 maintainability,  
 compatibility,  
 configurability,  
 serviceability,  
 installability, or  
 localizability (internationalization).  
 
Design 
Requirement 
(DES) 
A design requirement, often called a design constraint, specifies or constrains the 
design of a system. 
This section should indicate any design constraints on the system being built. Design 
constraints represent design decisions that have been mandated and must be adhered 
to.  Examples include software languages, software process requirements, prescribed 
use of developmental tools, architectural and design constraints, purchased 
components, class libraries, etc. 
 
Interface 
Requirement 
(INT) 
This section defines the interfaces that must be supported by the application. It 
should contain adequate specificity, protocols, ports and logical addresses, etc., so 
that the software can be developed and verified against the interface requirements. 
An interface requirement may be classified into: 
 User interface (user interfaces that are to be implemented by the software) 
 Hardware interface (hardware interfaces that are to be supported by the software, 
including logical structure, physical addresses, expected behavior, etc.) 
 Software interface (software interfaces to other components of the software 
system. These may be purchased components, components reused from another 
application or components being developed for subsystems outside of the scope 
of this project, but with which this software application must interact).

Types of Requirements, Continued 
 
Physical 
Requirement 
(HAR) 
A physical requirement specifies a physical characteristic that a system must possess; 
for example,  
 material,  
 shape,  
 size, and  
 weight.  
 
This type of requirement can be used to represent hardware requirements, such as  
 the physical network configurations required 
 
Applicable 
Standards 
Requirements 
(STD) 
This section describes by reference any applicable standards and the specific sections 
of any such standards that apply to the system being described. For example, this 
could include legal, quality and regulatory standards, industry standards for usability, 
interoperability, internationalization, operating system compliance, etc.

List of Functional Requirements 
 
Introduction 
Functional requirements specify actions that a system must be able to perform, 
without taking physical constraints into consideration. Functional requirements thus 
specify the input and output behaviour of a system. 
A list of these functional requirements is given below with an identification and a 
short description for each of them. 
These functional requirements are best described once translated into use cases (see 
Use Case Model chapter). 
 
List of 
functional 
requirements 
Each identified functional requirement is assigned a unique key “FUN-nn” where nn 
is a sequence number identifying the functional requirement. The table hereafter lists 
all the functional requirements :

Introduction 
 
What’s a Use-
Case Model ? 
A use-case model is a model of the system's intended functions and its surroundings. 
It serves as a contract between the customer, the users and the system developers on 
the functionality of the system, which allows : 
 
Customers and users to validate that the system will become what they 
expected. 
 
System developers to build what is expected. 
 
The same use-case model is used in system analysis, design, implementation, and 
testing. 
The use-case model consists of use cases and actors. 
 
What’s an 
Actor ? 
An actor defines a coherent set of roles that users of the system can play when 
interacting with it. A user can either be an individual or an external system. 
 
What’s a Use 
Case ? 
A use case defines a set of use-case instances, where each instance is a sequence of 
actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular 
actor. Each use case in the model is described in detail, showing step-by-step how 
the system interacts with the actors, and what the system does in the use case. Use 
cases function as a unifying thread throughout the software lifecycle.

Actor Catalog 
  
Introduction 
This map describes the list of identified actors. 
  
List of actors 
The following figure describes the different actors: 
CIA Appl ication
CIA Admini strator
TCN Administrator
A CIA Administrator is a single user who is in charge of administering the CIA application 
(exchanging XML messages with TACHOnet) in a Member State. 
From the TACHOnet viewpoint, the CIA Administrator will be assigned an account and will be 
granted the rights to browse the TCN usage statistics reports through a secure web site.
TACHOnet considers a whole CIA (Card Issuing Authority) as a single user (the CIA administrator 
excepted) through the CIA application, in charge of exchanging XML messages with TACHOnet. 
TACHOnet does not manage CIA users working with the CIA application (e.g. the clerks or 
enforcers performing administrative tasks). These latter ones have to be managed accordingly by 
each Member State's CIA under their own responsibility. 
From the TACHOnet viewpoint, the CIA application acts as a single user and will be defined 
accordingly (a single digital certificate will be delivered for a CIA application). Therefore, 
enforcers are also considered as CIA users who should then be managed by each Member State 
(TACHOnet only have a SPOC CIA).
A CIA Application will be granted the rights for carrying out any of the administrative tasks (see 
Administrative tasks for more details).
The TCN (TACHOnet) Administrator is in charge of administering the whole TACHOnet 
services in terms of configuration, performance, logging, tracking,... .
The TCN Administrator is not related to any CIA and works for the EC or Trusted Third Party 
company hosting and managing the TACHOnet services.
CIA User
Even though TACHOnet doesn't m anage any CIA  user (see above), a CIA user (i.e. clerks or 
enforcers) may have access to a web appl ication providi ng a user i nterface on top of the 
TACHOnet web servcices (phonex and transliterati on).

Use Case 01 – Check driver(s)’ issued cards 
 
Description 
This use case consists of processing a request for checking driver’s issued card 
coming from a Card Issuing Authority (CIA). Such request could contain the data for 
a single driver (online mode) or several drivers (batch mode).  
This use case is also used by enforcers (on behalf of CIA – as TACHOnet only sees 
CIA as SPOC) during road checks. 
 
Basic flow 
The basic flow consists of the following steps: 
 
Step 
Action 
1 
TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs the received request 
as-is in its tracking database. 
2 
TACHOnet validates its syntax and assigns it a TACHOnet refid 
(TCNRefId). 
3 
TACHOnet will build as many new requests as issuing Member State 
codes identified in the original request (+ another one for all sub-
requests not mentioning any issuing Member State code) by applying 
defined name encoding rules to the given surname(s) and first name(s) in 
order to compute the search keys. 
4 
For each issuing Member State identified (if any) in the original request, 
TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts a new request (only containing 
sub-requests for the corresponding issuing Member State), sends it to the 
corresponding Member State’s CIA application and waits for receiving 
the response. 
For the sub-request mentioning any issuing Member State code (if any), 
TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts a new request (only containing 
sub-requests not mentioning any issuing Member State), broadcasts it to 
all the Member States configured in TACHOnet (except the Member 
State having sent the original request) and waits for receiving each 
response. 
5 
For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as-is in its 
tracking database and validates its syntax. If it is valid, TACHOnet 
stores the response data (linked to the TCN refid) in the database (for 
later building the single consolidated response that TACHOnet will send 
when all responses are received or when the timeout is reached). 
6 
When all responses are received or when the timeout is reached, 
TACHOnet builds, from the received responses stored in its database, 
the single consolidated response. 
7 
TACHOnet logs the consolidated response is in its tracking database, 
encrypts it and sends it to the original caller.

Alternate flows 
Several alternate flows may exist depending on the result of some events/actions of 
the basic flow: 
 
Alternate 
flow 
Description 
ALT-01 
When TACHOnet receives a negative response from a Member State 
CIA, it should log it and consider the request sent to that Member 
State CIA as completed (with error).  
ALT-02 
When TACHOnet receives multiple responses (corresponding to a 
single request) from a Member State CIA, it should ignore the 
superfluous additional responses. The first received response is the 
processed one. 
ALT-03 
When TACHOnet doesn’t receive within time a Member State CIA 
response, it should mention ‘timeout’ as status code for that Member 
State CIA in the consolidated response. 
ALT-04 
When TACHOnet receives a late Member State CIA response, it 
should log it and ignore it. 
ALT-05 
When TACHOnet receives a syntactically invalid request / response, 
it should always send back a negative receipt with ‘Invalid Format 
request’ as status code and warn the TCN Administrator. 
ALT-06 
When TACHOnet receives an invalid XML message (request, 
response), it will respond with a negative receipt mentioning the 
reason (invalid format). 
 
Special 
requirements 
• Non-repudiation of transaction must be guaranteed 
• Data privacy must also be guaranteed 
• All Member State CIAs must provide services (using proposed messages formats 
below and proposed technical rules in [2]) for:

• Sending TACHOnet a response to such TACHOnet request (asynchronous) 
• Receiving and handling a TACHOnet response to original request for checking 
driver’s issued cards (asynchronous) 
 
Pre-conditions 
• The CIA requesting the check must be defined in TACHOnet

Use Case 02 – Check tachograph card status 
 
Description 
This use case consists of checking the status of a tachograph card based on its card 
number. This use case is very useful for CIAs in order to check the validity of a card 
prior to performing some administrative tasks (e.g. to avoid from declaring a 
lost/stolen card for a wrongly keyed-in card number,...). It is also useful for 
enforcement authorities during road-checks where workshop could also be checked 
(beside driver cards). 
The checked card is identified by its card number and its issuing Member State code. 
As an issued card must be unique, it should only exist in a single CIA data store (the 
CIA having issued the card). 
 
Basic flow 
The basic flow consists of the following steps: 
 
Step 
Action 
1 
TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs the received request 
as-is in its tracking database. 
2 
TACHOnet validates its syntax and assigns it a TACHOnet refid 
(TCNRefId). 
3 
TACHOnet will build as many new requests as issuing Member State 
codes identified in the original request. TACHOnet figures out the target 
issuing Member State(s) from the issuing Member State code given for 
each to-be-checked card. Every new request only contains card 
number(s) issued by a particular Member State. 
4 
For each identified issuing Member State(s), TACHOnet builds, logs and 
encrypts the new request, sends it to it and waits for receiving the 
response. 
5 
For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as-is in its 
tracking database and validates its syntax. If it’s valid, TACHOnet stores 
the response message (linked to the TCNRefId) in the database (for later 
building the single consolidated response that TACHOnet will send 
when all responses are received or when the timeout is reached). 
6 
When all responses are received or when the timeout is reached, 
TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts the consolidated response (from 
the responses received so far), and sends it to the original caller. 
 
Alternate flows 
The same alternate flows as described for UC-01 (page 23) may exist depending on 
the result of some events/actions of the basic flow.

Use Case 03 – Declaration of card status modification 
 
Description 
This use case consists of processing a request for declaring the modification of the 
status of card. It can be asked by CIA clerks or by enforcers.

The card status values in red ('Y' in 2nd column) will be defined as the only values allowed as 
new card status values in the TCN "ModCardStatus" transaction (XML message). TCN will not 
check the validity of the state transition declared in this transaction (e.g. it will not prevent 
declaring a card 'Exchanged' while its current status was 'Stolen' as TCN doesn't know the 
current card status). It's up the MS responsibility to check the validity of such state transition 
(and return a ModStatusCode=CardStatusInvalid in the XML response message).

Use Case 04 – Send Card/Driving License Assignment 
  
Description 
This use case is born from the “Luxemburg agreement” (see [3] for more details). It 
should be used by CIAs in the particular case when a card has been issued to a driver 
who showed a foreign driving license. The CIA must then warn, via TACHOnet, the 
Member State having issued the driving license that a brand new card has been 
issued with the corresponding driving license number. Upon receipt of such request, 
the Member State having issued the driving license should store that information 
(issued card number associated to the driving license number) in its own local data 
store. 
 
Basic flow 
The basic flow consists of the following steps: 
 
Step 
Action 
1 
TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs the received request 
as-is in its tracking database. 
2 
TACHOnet validates its syntax and assigns it a TACHOnet refid 
(TCNRefId). 
3 
TACHOnet will build as many new requests as issuing Member State 
codes identified in the original request (e.g. if more than one card/driving 
license number is given in the request). TACHOnet figures out the issuing 
Member State code(s) based on the driving license issuing nation (and not 
the card issuing Member State code) given for each sub request. Every 
new request only contains card and driving license number(s) issued by a 
particular Member State. 
4 
For each identified issuing Member State(s), TACHOnet builds, logs and 
encrypts the new request, sends it to the Member State and waits for 
receiving the response. 
5 
For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as-is in its 
tracking database and validates its syntax. If it’s valid, TACHOnet stores 
the response message (linked to the TCNRefId) in the database (for later 
building the single consolidated response that TACHOnet will send when 
all responses are received or when the timeout is reached). 
6 
When all responses are received or when the timeout is reached, 
TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts the consolidated response (from the 
responses received so far), and sends it to the original caller.

Use Case 05 – Get Phonex Search Keys 
 
Description 
This use case consists of getting from TACHOnet the computed search keys (based 
on the Phonex algorithm) corresponding to the given last name and first names.  
The Member State CIAs should call upon this service when issuing a new card to get 
the computed search keys of the driver’s surname and first names, so to store them in 
their local data store. When a Member State CIA will receive a TACHOnet request 
for checking driver’s issued card, it should use the search keys given in the request to 
search against their local data store (along with the given driver’s birth date). It’s 
therefore of major importance to use a common algorithm and to store computed 
search keys in the local data store. 
Nevertheless, Member States are free to use their own Phonetic algorithm (if existing 
like in Germany). In such a case, it’s the Member State responsibility to compute the 
search keys based on the given driver’s surname and first of the first names. 
 
Basic flow 
The basic flow consists of the following steps: 
 
Step 
Action 
1 
The CIA calls the TACHOnet service giving the driver’s surname and 
first names. 
2 
TACHOnet checks the input parameters and, if valid, computes the 
corresponding surname and first of the first names search keys. 
3 
TACHOnet returns the computed search keys as output parameters. 
 
Alternate flows 
2a 
If the input parameters are invalid (e.g. illegal character,…), TACHOnet 
returns a negative status code to the request. 
  
Special 
requirements 
• This service should ideally be implemented as a synchronous Web Service. 
• A web interface on top of this service should also be supplied to allow the CIA 
users to access manually these TACHOnet services. 
• A downloadable version of this web service should also be made available (.NET 
and Java) to enable some Member States to install and use it locally. 
  
Pre-conditions 
The caller must provide the mandatory input parameters. 
  
Post-conditions 
The caller has received the computed search keys (or a negative error code).

Use Case 07 – “Add a new CIA” 
  
Brief 
Description 
In order to get access to the Statistics Reporting part of the TACHOnet system, every 
Member State will be assigned a CIA Administrator’s account (and password). 
This use case enables the TCN Administrator to create a new CIA Administrator 
account in the Active Directory for a CIA Administrator using the Microsoft 
Management Console Active Directory Users and Computers 
(MMC). 
  
Primary Actor 
TCN Administrator (or delegates to the operator). 
 
Preconditions 
The actor has access to the Microsoft Management Console Active 
Directory Users and Computers. 
  
Postconditions 
The new CIA Administrator has been created and has now access to the 
ReportManager Web site. 
  
Stakeholders 
and Interest 
Access to the ReportManager Web site (providing the TCN usage statistics reports) 
should only be allowed to the CIA Administrators. Therefore, every CIA 
Administrator must be assigned a user account and password.

Description 
This use case consists of transferring (at regular interval – nightly basis) all expired 
TACHOnet transactions (completed or after timeout), storing them and generating 
some usage statistics for the TCN Administrator and every CIA Administrators. 
The usage statistics should give information about the incoming requests (from a 
CIA to TACHOnet) for a given period:  
 
The list of requests for the last 14 days (List). 
 
The percentage of each status code values (Timeout, ServerError,…) for each 
CIA (Consolidated chart). 
 
The count and percentage of each status code values for each CIA (Consolidated 
list). 
 
The count and percentage of each CIA for each type of requests (Consolidated 
list). 
 
The count and percentage of each type of requests (CheckIssuedCards, 
CheckCardStatus,…) for each mode – Batch and On-line - (Consolidated list). 
 
The usage statistics should give information about the outgoing requests (from 
TACHOnet to a CIA) for a given period:  
 
The list of requests for the last 14 days (List). 
 
The percentage of OK status code value for each CIA (Consolidated chart). 
 
The percentage of each status code values (Timeout, ServerError,…) for each

Use Case 11 – Log the message 
 
Description 
This use case consists of logging as-is every message sent or received by 
TACHOnet. 
Such logging is provided out-of-the-box by BizTalk and will be configured at the 
channel level using the BizTalk Messaging Manager tool. 
 
Basic flow 
The basic flow consists of the following steps: 
 
Step 
Action 
1 
Upon receiving a message, TACHOnet should log it as-is in the tracking 
database. 
2 
Prior to sending a message, TACHOnet should log it as-is in the tracking 
database. 
 
Alternate flows 
• TACHOnet should also provide a system for archiving (e.g. removing from the 
tracking database to flat files) “old” messages (how long should TACHOnet keep 
track of a message?).  
 
Special 
requirements 
• Great care must be taken when setting up the tracking database in terms of sizing 
(the number of the messages to be logged might quickly become huge), 
performance (the logging mechanism should not impede overall TACHOnet 
system performance), availability (high availability must be guaranteed through 
clustering,...) and security (restricted administrative access, strong backup 
policies,...).  
 
Pre-conditions 
• A message (request, response) is received by TACHOnet or about to be sent by 
TACHOnet. 
 
Post-conditions 
• The received/sent message is logged in the tracking database 
 
Actors 
• TACHOnet system

Use-Case 12 – “Monitor the system” 
  
Brief 
Description 
This use case consists of monitoring the whole TACHOnet system. 
Such monitoring will be based on the MOM (Microsoft Operations Manager) 
product, used as standard monitoring tool by the EC DI’s Data Center.  
Managing BizTalk through MOM is made possible by installing the BizTalk 
Management Pack for MOM. Nevertheless, as this pack consists of more than 700 
rules, some configuration need to be made (in close collaboration with EC DI’s Data 
Center people) to configure the set of rules required for monitoring the BizTalk 
configuration of TACHOnet. 
  
Primary Actor 
 
TCN Administrator 
  
Preconditions 
The TCN Administrator has access to the MOM console. 
  
Postconditions 
The TCN Administrator has managed alerts sent through the MOM console. 
  
Stakeholders 
and Interests 
In order to constantly keep the availability and performance of the TACHOnet 
system at an optimum level, the system must constantly monitored and should raise 
some events when particular problems (HW, SW,…) occur.  
  
Basic Flow 
See MOM documentation. 
  
Technology and 
Data Variations 
List

Assumptions 
 
MOM is used as central monitoring system. 
  
Open issues 
 
Will the TACHOnet servers be directly monitored from the central MOM 
console or should TACHOnet provide ? 
 
Is there any special FW configuration between the TACHOnet servers and the 
central MOM console? 
 
What are the BizTalk rules that need be configured in MOM and how?

Use-Case 13 – “Manage Member State” 
  
Brief 
Description 
This use case consists of managing a Member State CIA in terms of TACHOnet 
configuration (add, edit, remove a Member State CIA). 
  
Primary Actor 
 
TCN Administrator 
  
Preconditions 
The TCN Administrator has access to the BizTalk Messaging Manager and 
BizTalk Server Administration tools. 
  
Postconditions 
The Member State CIA configuration in TACHOnet has been updated. 
  
Stakeholders 
and Interests 
All Member States will not be ready at production day 1. Moreover, new candidate 
Member States will potentially join TACHOnet in the near future. The configuration 
of existing Member States could also change. Therefore, it’s important to provide the 
TCN Administrator with the tools or procedures to manage the TACHOnet 
configuration of a Member State. 
  
Basic Flow 
Managing Member States consists of adding a new Member State or modifying the 
current configuration of a Member State (url address, digital certificates,…) or 
removing a Member State (?). All these manual tasks will be described in details in 
the “TCN Operational Guide” document. Anyway, some of these major tasks are 
outlined below: 
Adding a new Member State: 
The following table lists the activities to carry out to add a new Member State in the 
TACHOnet configuration: 
 
BizTalk configuration: 
 
Create the BizTalk organization corresponding to the new Member State 
(“TCN_<countrycode>”) with its relevant properties. 
 
Create the corresponding BizTalk messaging ports. 
 
Create the corresponding BizTalk distribution list (“All-
<countrycode>”). 
 
Update all the other BizTalk distribution lists to add the new messaging port 
(send request) corresponding to the new Member State. 
 
Create the corresponding BizTalk channels. 
 
Create the corresponding BizTalk receive functions (in test environment). 
 
Reporting System: 
 
Add a new CIA Administrator account

 
Changing the url address where TACHOnet should send XML messages: 
 
Update the transport type of the BizTalk messaging port corresponding to 
the Member State. 
  
Technology and 
Data Variations 
List 
 
BizTalk Server 2002 provides the necessary tools to manage its configuration. 
These will be leveraged to update the Member States configuration. 
 
Assumptions 
The TCN Administrator is a BizTalk Administrator and has access to the BizTalk 
Messaging Manager and BizTalk Server Administration tools (or 
will delegate to the effective BizTalk Administrator).
