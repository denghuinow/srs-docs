1. Introduction


1.1 Purpose and Perspective
A program of the Georgia Public Library Service, Georgia Library PINES
(Public Information Network for Electronic Services) is the public library
automation and lending network for more than 275 libraries and affiliated
service outlets in almost 140 counties.  PINES creates a statewide
"borderless library" that provides equal access to information for all
Georgians. Georgians with a PINES library card have access to materials
beyond what is available on their local shelves and enjoy the benefits of a
shared collection of 9.6 million books and other materials that can be
delivered to their home library free of charge.  PINES has been running its
shared bibliographic and patron databases on the Evergreen ILS, which was
originally developed by the Georgia Public Library Service for use in
PINES.

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes the functional and
nonfunctional requirements for Management Processes of an Integrated
Library System (ILS). The requirements, while originally developed
specifically for King County Library System, have been adapted for the
Public Information Network for Electronic Services (PINES) as they are
believed to be suitable for many large, urban, multiple-branch, centralized
library systems.

The requirements in this SRS presuppose the general data structures and
functionality of a full-fledged ILS. The Management Processes will replace
and enhance the current capabilities of Evergreen, as well as add new
functionality. 


1.1a Formation and Mission of PINES Reports Working Group
The PINES Reports Working Group was formed in response to a need to make
recommendations for improvements of the Evergreen ILS reports interface.
King County (Washington) Library System, in collaboration with the Galecia
Group, had already developed a software requirements specification for a
reports interface and PINES staff took the opportunity to build a PINES-
specific requirements document on that foundation.  Katherine Gregory,
PINES Services Specialist, requested group members from the existing PINES
Reports Subcommittee, and included PINES library directors in a call for
volunteers.  The resulting PINES Reports Working Group consists of one
library director, three assistant library directors, and a systems
librarian, all of whom have significant experience developing reports for
PINES libraries.  The mission statement of the PINES Reports Working Group
is as follows:


      Reports Working Group Mission:

      Document optimal Reports functionality within a future Evergreen
      release and develop a list of requirements.

      Become the Reports testing group, through which all new Reports
      development would be filtered.

      Compile a list of reports needed for an Executive Reports Interface.

      Determine and create templates needed for all PINES libraries.

1.2 Product Scope and Features
The Management Processes facilitates the management of Library services,
programs, and policies. Specifically, the Management Processes support the
following activities, among others:

    o Analyzing the Library collection and its use by patrons.

    o Analyzing branch capacity and optimal distribution of the collection.

    o Analyzing the demographics and interests of the Library’s patrons.

    o Analyzing staff productivity and workflow.

    o Tracking and verifying financial transactions.

The current specification presupposes the general functionality of an ILS
and specifies only those requirements that directly or indirectly relate to
management activities. PINES is currently working on specifications for
Acquisitions and Cataloging modules.

Moreover, the current specification is focused on functional
characteristics of Management Processes. Data structures and user
interfaces will require further specification and development using an
iterative, prototype-oriented software development methodology.

1.3 Intended Audience
This SRS is intended both for library managers and staff who may contribute
additional requirements or commentary, and for software project managers
and developers who will implement the requirements. As such, it aims for a
high level of readability for a non-technical audience, while providing
enough specificity to be useful to a software developer. 

It is assumed that when software development occurs, it will be in a highly
collaborative and iterative environment in which end-users have multiple
opportunities to review prototypes and refine the user interface and
software functionality.

It is also assumed that the reader has a general understanding of Library
services and processes and does not require definition of common Library
terminology.

1.4 Document Conventions
The SRS includes requirements. Requirements include a reference to a
process flowchart where appropriate. Flowcharts generally indicate the
current approach to Management Processes in PINES, and should be considered
to give contextual information rather than to prescribe or constrain new
software development.

1.6 Operating Environment
OE-1: Management Processes support the needs of a large, multiple-system
library consortium and its individual component systems and branches.
Specifically, the system must support a library consortium with 286
locations, 17 million annual circulations, purchasing and processing over
900,000 items per year. It is highly desirable that searches and reports
can be processed during open hours without disrupting other system
functions.

OE-2: Management Processes shall operate on a Linux or Solaris server.

OE-3:       Management Processes shall be accessible through a web-browser
or a Windows-compatible client.

OE-4:       If web-browser based, Management Processes shall be accessible
through Microsoft Internet Explorer (v.6.0 and later) and Mozilla Firefox
(v.2.0 and later).

OE-5:  Management Processes shall be accessible with screen-reading
software, screen-magnification software, and other software programs
designed to increase accessibility.


1.7 Design and Implementation Constraints

CO-1: Management Processes shall use a fully relational database back-end.

CO-2: Management Processes shall produce standards-compliant HTML.

CO-3: Management Processes shall provide a development and training
environment with the ability to migrate configurations to a production
environment.

CO-4:       User rights and privileges will be controlled through security
groups and/or “roles” that allow access control for individuals,
workgroups, and arbitrary staff groups.

CO-5: These requirements shall not constrain functionality or features of
the Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) module.

1.8 User Documentation
UD-1  The software developer shall provide complete data specifications for
authority records, bibliographic records, order records, item records,
hold/request records, and other records maintained or accessed by
Management Processes.

UD-2: The software developer shall provide a thorough high-level
description of major processes, including bibliographic record import and
export, validation of bibliographic records against internal and external
authority sources, and standard reports.

UD-3: The system shall provide an online, hierarchical, and cross-linked
help system in HTML that describes and illustrates all system functions.

UD-4: The system shall provide thorough high-level error reporting and
feedback and shall allow low-level query-specific feedback for Local and
Global System Administrators from the front-end interface.

1.9 Assumptions and Dependencies
AS-1: Management Processes are part of an enterprise-level Library
Automation System.

AS-2: Management Processes are consolidated at a central location, and
accept input and provide services to multiple locations.

DE-1: Management Processes rely on the data structures and functionality of
an enterprise-level Library Automation System, including Acquisitions and
Cataloging modules.

DE-2: Management Processes interface with a variety of vendor websites, via
published APIs and/or automated transfer of standard-format data files
(e.g. USMARC21, EDIFACT).

DE-3: Management Processes interact with a patron interface, also known as
an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC).

      checked of for inclusion or exclusion when filtering as well as all of

    • An Open template would have all attributes associated with items,
      patrons, bills, circulation, and bib records to select from for
      filtering and the same attributes for displaying.  
    • For instance, Circulation would have an option to check a box to
      filter by circ mod.  This would have the attribute of circ modifier as
      a selection to include or exclude and then have a drop down to select
      any circ mods to filter by.  All filter options would be listed as
      display option as well.  So, a display option would be circ modifier.
