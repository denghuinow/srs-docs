1. Introduction 
 
1.1 Purpose 
The present document is a software requirements specification document for PeaZip , 
version 2.7.1. PeaZip is a general purpose file and archive manager application for a computer 
system, aiming to provide a cross-platform graphical interface for many Open Source archiving and 
compression utilities, so that its user would be able to handle most of the available archiving 
formats(indicatively: 7z,RAR,ZIP. Full list of the supported formats is provided in following 
chapters). 
 
This document follows “Software Requirements Specification” template for software 
requirements specification documents, by Karl E. Wiegers, with a few declensions. 
1.2 Document Conventions 
The present document concerns software engineers that would work on further 
development of this piece of software, as well as clients/users of PeaZip. 
  
This is the only document so far describing PeaZip’s software requirements. It should be 
used by software engineers who will develop this piece of software and it should be used for 
formalization of the software that is going to be delivered to clients/users. Every future change in 
the requirements of this software should be made through a typical procedure of change and final 
acceptance of this document. 
 
Software engineers should ask for further explanation or clarification, if and wherever they 
decide this is necessary and should not proceed to modifications without the approval of the final 
client/user. 
1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions 
This document applies to programmers of this project, to software engineers that weal work 
on its further development and, finally, to the end users of this application and it aims at displaying 
the features of PeaZip version 2.7.1, as well as at providing information about the goals and the 
proper use of the software. 
 
Chapters that would interest users are: 3, 4 and 6, whereas the whole document would be 
of interest for software engineers and programmers. 
1.4 Project Scope 
The piece of software to which the present document refers, is a file and archive manager 
application for a computer system, that offers user the capability of archiving,compressing and 
extracting (decompressing) files and archives.  
 
In brief, the basic functions that PeaZip features are: 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 2 
 
 
Creating compressed archives, updating compressed archives, extracting content of compressed 
archives, file and archive management tools(robust copy, split and join, fast or secure deletion, 
byte to byte comparison, calculation of a wide set of checksums and hashes over selected files), 
append timestamp to archive name(useful for archiving and backup purpose) and two factor 
authentication(password and keyfile) for the managed archives. All pre-mentioned functions’ 
parameters can be modified and adapted to user’s needs and preferences from a settings’ menu. 
 
The initial goal of this application was creating a frontend for Pea archiving utility. However, 
after completing PeaZip’s GUI, support to many mainstream archiving and compression formats 
was added to PeaZip. In this way, PeaZip became an aggregate frontend GUI for a set of Open 
Source archiving and compression utilities(full list of which is provided in following chapters). The 
fact that this application is Open Source software, gives its users the chance to directly take part in 
its development, as well as notice possible bugs or mistakes and make their suggestions on it. 
 
This is a picture of PeaZip:

2. Overall Description 
2.1 Product Perspective 
Peazip was created for file and archive management in a computer system. The initial goal 
of the application was to function as frontend for Pea archiving utility(which was also developed by 
PeaZip’s creator, Giorgio Tani). However, after completing the development of PeaZip UI, support 
to more archiving and compression formats (full list of which is provided in following chapters) was 
added to PeaZip, allowing it to function as a single, consistent frontend GUI, which exposes a list 
of options of the underlying applications. 
PeaZip works similarly to a large group of well-known applications, like WinRAR and 
WinZip. PeaZip features, to a large degree, the same features with the applications of this group 
and in addition, it supports a wide range of archiving and compression formats(superset of the 
supported by each application of the pre-mentioned group set)as well as some file and archive 
management tools(which are mentioned explicitly in following chapters), while at the same time it 
offers its users the capability of executing its functions as command prompt commands(resulting 
commands can be extracted and saved in a text file), allowing them to monitor any running activity 
in real-time. 
  
An important attribute of PeaZip is its self-standingness and its independency from the kind 
of the Operating System of the computer system on which it runs. In no case is the installation of 
any other program required for PeaZip to work, while for cases that no system integration is 
preferred, PeaZip Portable is available as standalone application, not needing installation and not 
modifying the host system.

2.2 Product Features 
PeaZip is a general purpose file and archive manager application for a computer system, 
aiming to provide a cross-platform graphical interface for many Open Source archiving and 
compression utilities. The most important features that are offered by those utilities, through 
PeaZip, are the following: 
 
• 
Creating archives in any of the supported archiving and compression formats(full list of 
which is provided in following chapters) 
• 
Updating an already existing archive 
• 
Appending timestamp with  date and time on the managed archive name for archiving and 
backup purpose 
• 
Two factor (password and keyfile) authentication for the managed files and archives 
• 
Extracting contents of any compressed in any of the supported archiving and compression 
formats (full list of which is provided in following chapters) archive 
• 
Secure file and archive deletion from any storing unit of the computer system on which 
PeaZip runs 
• 
Byte to byte comparison between tow files 
• 
Check files in order to find duplicate files and to check files for corruption 
• 
Splitting files and merging split volumes back to original file 
• 
Information list, which lists contend of selected files/archives. In info mode, it shows number 
of files  and archives, newer and older object’s date/time of last modification, total space 
occupation and larger and smaller object’s size 
• 
View content of a file or archive represented as hexadecimal values 
• 
Graphical monitoring of all executed functions 
 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 5 
 
 
All functions above can be modified and adapted to users’ preferences through a settings 
menu. Moreover, any of those features can be executed as command prompt command. Finally, 
more than one of those features can be applied to a single archive or file. 
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics 
This software applies to any user of any computer system. There is no limitation on who 
would be able to or allowed to use PeaZip, as PeaZip is an application that could be used by any 
user of a computer system who would like to manage (archiving and compression) files and 
archives of the system. 
 
PeaZip users can be divided into two main categories: to the ones that have already used 
an archiving and compression application and to all the rest. Even though PeaZip functions are 
relatively simple and PeaZip’s interface is pleasant and user friendly, users included in both 
categories, should read the tutorials and help documents that have been written about the 
particular application(and are either available in sites that are mentioned in following chapter or 
inside the application), so as to inform themselves on the application scope and needs that it 
covers, as well as to be able to use in full extend all, featured by the application, functions.. 
 
Another distinction of PeaZip users in categories, could be made according to user’s 
experience and knowledge on using computer systems. In this case, however, the distinction into a 
discrete number of categories is not easy, because it is not possible to put unambiguous boarders 
between categories according to users’ experience and knowledge level on using computer 
systems, as it is a non-countable amount. Still, in general, it could be claimed that users with larger 
experience and knowledge on using computer systems, could use more easily some advanced 
features offered by PeaZip, such as executing its function in command prompt. 
2.4 Operating Environment 
As far as operating systems are concerned PeaZip is compatible with: 
 
• 
All 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows 
• 
All 32-bit Microsoft Windows(95/98/ΝΤ/2000/ΧP/Vista) 
• 
All POSIX(all versions of  Linux/all versions of BSD/all UNIX-like operating systems) 
 
Moreover, PeaZip is available as source code that is compatible with almost any operating system. 
It is obvious, that PeaZip is independent from the operating system of the computer system on 
which it runs. 
 
As far as hardware is concerned, PeaZip requires an x-86 compatible CPU, due to some 
performance critical sections written in ASM. In general, CPU and RAM requisites of PeaZip, are 
bound to the chosen algorithm and compression level, ranging from a few KB for simpler 
algorithms (like when storing files in tar/gz/zip formats) to above than a GB for more complex 
algorithms and higher compression level (like LZMA, PPMd and PAQ). Needless to say, it is the 
choice of the compression algorithm that is the most important factor that determines the job's 
speed, even if usually more advanced algorithms are the ones that scale better in performances in 
multi-core environments. 
 
To conclude, as far as software is concerned, all needed software invoked by the frontend 
is included in PeaZip packages (available under suitable licenses, as open source or royalty free) 
so no custom package is needed to be installed to make PeaZip work (with the possible exception 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 6 
 
 
of some standard gtk/gdk related libraries needed to run PeaZip, Gwrap and Pea binaries, which 
may be missing in some computer systems, but are well known, trustable and widely available). 
 
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints 
Should anyone wish to work on further development of PeaZip knowledge in any of the 
following programming languages is required: 
 
• 
Delphi/Kylix 
• 
Object Pascal 
• 
Pascal 
 
This software’s license is LGPL, which mean that PeaZip is 100% Open Source and 100% free 
and it can be used be linked to any other software regardless of whether it is free software or 
proprietary software. Everyone that does or is going to develop or use PeaZip, should agree and 
fully accept the terms of this kind of license. 
 
 
Moreover, PeaZip is developed under the development environment Lazarus 
IDE(http://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/). 
2.6 User Documentation

PeaZip’s users can browse and gain access, in various ways, to every area (e.g. 
storing units, desktop, users documents etc) of the computer system on which 
PeaZip runs, as well as to included objects (archives and files). 
3.1.2 
Stimulus/Response Sequences 
In the initial window of the application (which is also going to be mentioned as file 
manager interface) there is a button writing “File” on it. By pressing this particular 
button, opens a submenu with choices that have to do with browsing and access to 
areas and objects of the computer systems 
 
              
 
                    4. Browsing submenu 
 
More specifically: 
By choosing “Filesystem”, users can get access to an object from an object list of 
objects that is organized according to a functional hierarchy.. 
By choosing “Bookmarks”, users can get access to an object from a list of objects 
that have been rated by them as favorites. 
By choosing “Recent archives”, users can get access to an object from a list of 
objects that have been recently browsed in PeaZip. 
Finally, through “Open path” and “Open archive”, users can get direct access to a 
path of an object or a file/archive. 
 
Moreover, browsing and access to computer system’s objects is provided by 
navigation bar of the file manager interface, with navigation buttons (back, forward, 
up) and refresh button.

By this feature, users are allowed to search and gain access to objects they would 
like to manage. 
3.1.3 
Functional Requirements 
Installation of no other application is required, for PeaZip to manage this function. 
The only functional requirement is: 
 
  
REQ-1: Operating system on the computer system. 
3.2 System Feature 2 
Variety of ways of selection of displayed in file manager interface objects. 
 
3.2.1 
Description and priority 
Users are allowed to manage the way of selection of the displayed in file manager 
interface objects(files and archives). 
3.2.2 
Stimulus/Response Sequences 
In the initial window of the application(file manager interface), there is a button writing  
“Edit” on it. By pressing this particular button, opens a submenu with choices that 
have to do with altering ways of selection of files displayed currently at file manager 
interface. 
 
           
 
 5. Selection submenu. 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 9 
 
 
More specifically: 
“Select all”, selects all objects that are currently displayed at file mager interface. 
“Invert selection”, allows inverted selection of objects(this means that all non-
selected before the beginning of the function objects are selected and all selected 
before the beginning of the function objects are deselected). 
“All objects…” set of commands, allows selection from the objects displayed on file 
manager interface, according to: extension, attributes, size and date.. 
Finally, “Sort by selection status”, sorts all objects on file manager interface 
according to whether they are selected or not. 
 
With this feature users are allowed to flexibly alternate the way of selection of 
currently displayed objects on file manager interface. This feature is particularly 
useful for object selection for mass management, especially when the number of 
currently displayed objects on file manager interface is large (thus manual selection 
object-by-object could lead to errors). 
3.2.3 
Functional Requirements 
  
Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System 
Feature 1. 
3.3 System Feature 3 
Accessibility to main application interfaces(other than file manager interface)and modification of  
view mode for objects in file manager interface. 
 
3.3.1 
Description and Priority 
Users are allowed to instantly access other main application interfaces(specifically 
create archive interface and extraction interface-these features are described in 
following chapters), as well as changing view mode for  objects(archives and files) 
displayed in file manager interface. 
3.3.2 
Stimulus/Response Sequences 
In the initial window of the application(file manager interface), there is a button writing 
“Browser” on it. By pressing this particular button, opens a submenu with choices 
that have to do with transferring to main interfaces of PeaZip and selecting view 
mode for objects (archives and files) displayed in file manager interface.

       6. Transfer and view mode selection submenu. 
 
More specifically: 
“Go to archiving layout”, leads directly to create archive interface. 
 “Go to extraction layout”, leads directly to extraction interface. 
(Note: the previous two functions are described in detail in following chapters, 
whereas the sequence of actions that was described is not the only way of 
approaching those two interfaces). 
“Toggle browse/flat view”, displays all together the objects contained in the current 
path or in the archive. 
Finally, “Refresh”, refresh/update of currently displayed content 
 
This particular feature allows users to gain direct access to other main interfaces of 
PeaZip than file manager interface. In addition, it offers an overview of the objects 
that are displayed in file manager interface, which helps users to handle them better. 
3.3.3 
Functional Requirements 
Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System 
Feature 1. 
3.4 System Feature 4 
Computer system management utilities. 
  
3.4.1

Users can use, through PeaZip, multiple computer system (both for storage units and 
the system itself) management tools. 
3.4.2 
Stimulus/Response Sequences 
In the initial window of the application(file manager interface), there is a button writing 
“Tools” on it. By pressing this particular button, opens a submenu with choices that 
have to do, among others, with gaining access to tool and utilities for computer 
system management. 
  
 
 
         
 
           7. Computer system management tools and utilities. 
 
 
More specifically: 
“System tools”, collects system’s disk utilities (clean, defrag, manage, remove), 
system management tools (control panel, computer management, task manager) 
and displays environment variables (both for Linux and Windows). 
“System benchmark” utility, rates the host system in terms of MIPS (millions of 
integer instructions per second)and Core 2 Duo equivalent speed in MHz. 
 
Through this feature, users can have quick and easy access to basic tools and 
utilities of computer system management, through PeaZip application. In this way,

users can fine tune every possible procedure that takes place in the computer 
system. 
3.4.3 
Functional Requirements 
Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System 
Feature 1. 
3.5 System Feature 5 
File management utilities that are not strictly archiving-related. 
 
3.5.1 
Description and Priority 
Users can access a group of file management tools, that are not strictly archiving-
related. Users can choose from a set of utilities, like: secure file deletion, byte to byte 
comparison between two files, file checking, file split/join, file information display and 
hexadecimal preview of the content of a file.  
3.5.2 
Stimulus/Response Sequences 
PeaZip, offers access to a series of file management tools, from the initial window of 
the application (file manager interface), as well as from create archive window(create 
archive interface) and extraction window(extraction interface). 
 
More specifically, functions that are features by the tools mentioned above are: 
- Secure file deletion, intended for securely remove files and folders from disk, 
avoiding possible data recovery. This is implemented by multiple successive passes 
of the deletion procedure over the storage area of the selected for deletion file. 
-Byte to byte file comparison, which spots exactly what the different bytes are and is 
not susceptible to collisions under any circumstance, even if conditions are highly 
improbable and very difficult or not practically possible to trigger if a proper hash 
function is chosen. 
- Check files, which is useful for finding duplicate files and checking files for 
corruption when an original checksum or hash value is known. 
-Split file and merge split volumes back to the original file. 
-Information display for selected (by users) files. Number of files, older and newer 
object’s date/time, total space occupation, and larger and smaller object’s sizes are 
presented. 
- Hexadecimal preview, which allows view of the content of a file represented as 
hexadecimal values. 
 
Through this set of features, users are allowed to handle files easier and more 
adequately. 
3.5.3 
Functional Requirements 
Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System 
Feature 1. 
 
3.6 System Feature 6 
Archive extraction. 
 
3.6.1 
Description and Priority 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 13 
 
 
Users can use PeaZip for decompressing the contents of a selected (by them) 
compressed archive and extract them in a folder. Name and storage space of the 
folder in the computer system, are up to users to decide. The archive, whose 
contents are extracted, is neither destroyed, nor deleted and it is not left empty. On 
the contrary, it retains its content and name and remains saved at the same place of 
the computer system that was initially stored. 
  
For the procedure of decompression and extraction to be completed, it is necessary 
that the selected archive is of one of the supported for extraction by PeaZip formats. 
In case the selected archive is encrypted, user must know and insert password and 
(if there is one) keyfile in order to have access to the archives contents (for browsing 
or extracting them). 
 
Read-only (browsing and extraction) formats supported by PeaZip: 
7z, 7z-sfx, ARC/WRC, BZ2/TBZ2, custom, GZ/TGZ, PAQ/LPAQ, PEA, QUAD/BALZ, 
split, TAR, UPX, ZIP, ACE, ARJ, CAB, CHM, COMPOUND(MSI, DOC, XLS, PPT), 
CPIO, ISO, Java(JAR, EAR, WAR), Linux(DEB, PET/PUP, RPM, SLP), LHA/LZH, 
LZMA, Mac(DMG/HFS), NSIS, Open Office files, PAK/PK3/PK4, RAR,SMZIP, U3P, 
UDF, VHD, WIM, XAR, XPI, XZ, Z/TZ 
3.6.2 
Stimulus/Response Sequences 
Decompression/Extraction function is set off and defined in extraction window (which 
is also going to be referred as extraction interface). Users can get access to this 
window in one of the following ways: 
1) By selecting one or more archives that have suitable format for decompression 
and extraction of their content from file manager interface and then pressing the 
button writing “Extract” on it, from the toolbar. This is the icon of the button: 
 
 
                                                                    
 
 
2) By pressing the button writing “Browser” on it, in file manager interface and then 
selecting “Go to extraction layout” from the submenu that appears. 
3) By selecting one or more archives that have suitable format for decompression 
and extraction of their content from file manager interface, clicking the right button of 
the mouse of the computer system(or the equivalent button of the equivalent input 
device that the computer system may have)and then choosing “Extract” or “Extract(in 
new folder)”. 
4) By selecting one or more archives that have suitable format for decompression 
and extraction of their content from some area of the computer system(outside of the 
applications graphical environment), clicking the right button of the mouse of the 
computer system(or the equivalent button of the equivalent input device that the 
computer system may have)and then choosing “Extract”, “Extract here” or “Extract 
here(in new folder)” from “Send to” menu.

              8. Extraction window (Extraction Interface). 
 
In Extraction window (Extraction Interface), users are given the ability of choosing the 
storage space in the computer system in which the file that will contain the extracted 
from the compressed archive objects will be saved, of choosing name for this file (as 
well as defining what should happen in case of existence of a homonym file or 
archive in the selected storage space) and of inserting password and (if needed) 
keyfile, in case the archive is encrypted (locked).  
 
This feature is one of the most important for users, because not only does it offer 
access to the contents of a compressed, in one of the supported by PeaZip formats, 
archive, but it allows extraction of those contents in non-compressed format too, in 
order to be used according to users’ desires. 
3.6.3 
Functional Requirements 
Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System 
Feature 1. 
3.7 System Feature 7 
Archive creation and update. 
 
3.7.1 
Description and Priority 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 15 
 
 
Users are allowed to compress one or more objects (files or archives) in one or more 
compressed archive volumes (sizing less or equally to the original ones)in one of the 
offered for compression by PeaZip formats. Furthermore, users are allowed to 
update an archive (by adding extra objects-files or archives-to an already existing 
archive), as well as choose objects that are to be included in an archive. 
 
Name and storage space (in the computer system) for the created archives are 
defined by users. In cases of updating (adding objects) the name of the compressed 
file which is updated and its storage space remain the same as they were before the 
update. The objects that are contained in the created archive are not destroyed, are 
not deleted and are not left empty. On the contrary, they retain their content and 
name and remain saved at the same space of the computer system where they were 
initially stored. Furthermore, encryption (“lock”) can be used for the created archives 
by setting password and (optionally) keyfile. Compression to read-only supported 
formats is not possible. 
 
Fully supported by PeaZip archiving and compression formats: 
7z, 7z-sfx, ARC/WRC, BZ2/TBZ2, custom, GZ/TGZ, PAQ/LPAQ, PEA, QUAD/BALZ, 
split, TAR, UPX, ZIP

Creating and Updating archives feature is set off and defined in Create archive 
window (which is also going to be referred as Create archive Interface). Users can 
approach this window in one of the following ways: 
1) By pressing the button writing “File” on it in file manager interface and then 
selecting “Create archive” from the submenu that appears. 
2) By pressing the button writing “Browser” on it in file manager interface and then 
selecting “Go to archiving layout” from the submenu that appears. 
3) By selecting one or more objects to be added to an archive from file manager 
interface and then pressing the button writing “Add” on it from the toolbar. This is the 
icon of the button: 
 
                                                                     
 
 
4) By selecting one or more objects to be added to an archive from file manager 
interface, clicking the right button of the mouse of the computer system (or the 
equivalent button of the equivalent input device that the computer system may have) 
and then selecting “Add” from the submenu. 
5) By selecting one or more objects to be added to an archive from some area of the 
computer system (outside of the applications graphical environment), clicking the 
right button of the mouse of the computer system (or the equivalent button of the 
equivalent input device that the computer system may have) and then selecting “Add 
to separate archives” from “Send to” menu.

                   9. Create archive window(Create archive Interface). 
 
In Create archive window(Create archive Interface), users are given the ability to 
select compression format (from a list of the supported by PeaZip formats for 
archiving and compression) for the created archive, choose storage space (in the 
computer system) where the archive is going to be saved and set archive’s name (as 
well as define what should happen in case of existence of a homonym file or archive 
in the selected storage space). Moreover, selected objects’ data content can be split 
and be compressed into more than one archive volumes (size of each of them is 
defined by user). Furthermore, timestamp can be appended to the created archive’s 
name for archiving and backup purpose. Finally, encryption(“locking”)of created 
archives is available, by setting password and (optionally) keyfile to them.. 
 
Archive creation and update feature is a basic PeaZip feature, as it essentially allows 
users to save storage space on their computer systems by offering high compression 
formats, as well as including multiple objects’ content (which can be extracted in their 
initial, non-compressed format) in one single compressed archive. This makes 
handling and managing multiple objects as a single unit possible. Hence, the double 
advantage that this feature offers is obvious.  
 
The additional utility of spitting compressed archives in volumes that is offered to 
users in terms of this feature, allows size adjustment of the created file, while the 
utility of joining them, brings contended data to their initial state, so that 
decompression and extraction is possible. In this way, users are able to flexibly 
manage archives and adapt application’s use to their needs, since a wide range of 
choices is offered by PeaZip. 
3.7.3 
Functional Requirements 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 17 
 
 
Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System 
Feature 1. 
3.8 System Feature 8 
Support of drag and drop between system and application. 
 
3.8.1 
Description and Priority 
Users can drag and drop objects (files or archives) between any computer system 
space and the application. Application’s interfaces that support drag and drop, are 
file manager interface, create archive interface and extraction interface.  
3.8.2 
Stimulus/Response Sequences 
PeaZip supports drag and drop for object transfer between computer system and the 
interfaces of the application. Application’s interfaces that support this feature, are file 
manager interface, create archive interface and extraction interface. 
  
Specifically: 
• 
When files and folders are dragged and dropped to the file manager, they get 
listed in the archive creation interface (as if they were selected and added 
with “Add” button, as it was described in previous chapters), allowing fine 
tuning of the function before confirming or canceling it. In the same way, 
objects that are dragged and dropped to file manager interface while 
browsing an archive, will be added to the current archive, if the archive format 
allows modifications (e.g. adding objects to an archive format that is 
supported for reading only will not be possible). 
• 
Dragging an archived object (file or archive) from PeaZip to the system, will 
extract it to the location (of the computer system) where it is dropped. If 
dragged objects are contained in a compressed archive, then they are 
automatically decompressed before being extracted to the location where 
they are dropped. If the dragged objects are not contained in a compressed 
archive, they are just copied to the location where they are dropped. 
 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 18 
 
 
 
  10. Support of drag and drop (here from application to system). 
 
 
This feature allows users to fast and directly set off basic PeaZip’s functions, making 
PeaZip even handier. 
3.8.3 
Functional Requirements 
Installation of no other application is required, for PeaZip to manage this function. 
The only functional requirements are:  
 
REQ-1: Operating system on the computer system, for dragging and   
dropping objects from computer system to the application. 
REQ-2: MS Windows (any version) operating system on the computer 
system for dragging and dropping objects from the application to the 
computer system. Other operating systems (with which PeaZip is 
compatible), do not support this function of this feature. 
3.9 System Feature 9 
Two factor authentication (password and optionally keyfile). 
 
3.9.1 
Description and Priority 
PeaZip allows users to encrypt (“lock”) archives during creation or updating, by using 
password which is demanded by PeaZip (or other applications of the same use) and 
should be inserted, in case some user wants to gain access to an encrypted 
(“locked”) archive in order to manage it (e.g. browse it, update it, extract its content). 
For higher security reasons, PeaZip offers users the ability to use keyfile for archives 
encryption, in addition to the password. Finally, PeaZip can generate a random 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 19 
 
 
password and create a random keyfile. Obviously, apart from encryption, PeaZip 
supports decryption (“unlock”) of encrypted files. 
3.9.2 
Stimulus/Response Sequence 
In case a user wishes to “lock” an archive (during creation or update process) by 
setting password and (optionally) keyfile to it, that can be achieved in one of the 
following ways: 
-by pressing, during the archive creation process, the icon with the lock on it and set 
password and (optionally) keyfile, according to user’s preference.  
-by selecting, the archive  to be updated, that needs to be “locked” from file manager 
interface, pressing the button writing “Tools” on it and selecting “Enter 
password/keyfile” from the submenu. Password and (optionally) keyfile may then be 
set in the window that appears. 
-by selecting the archive to be updated,that needs to be “locked” from file manager 
interface and pressing the icon with the lock on it, which appears on the status-bar 
(bottom right corner). Password and (optionally) keyfile may then be set in the 
window that appears.  
 
 
 
                                 
   
                                                          11. Set password and keyfile.

                  12. Buttons for accessing encryption feature.      
                         
-in cases that users wish to use password and/or keyfile that the application has 
created, they have to select the archive they wish to “lock” from file manager 
interface, press the button writing “Tools” on it and then select “Create keyfile” on the 
appearing submenu. The only thing left is setting the suggested password and 
(optionally) keyfile to the (created or updated) archive in one of the ways mentioned 
above.

                                             13. Password and Keyfile generation utility. 
 
This feature is really important for the security of the managed archives and their 
content data. It allows users to set protection over managed archives and ensure in a 
way, that no unauthorized user will have access to them.  
3.9.3 
Functional Requirements 
Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System 
Feature 1.

Graphic display of currently executed functions. 
 
3.10.1 Description and Priority 
PeaZip offers graphic display of the progress of any currently executed through/by it 
function, through its graphic wrapper, named PeaLauncher. In PeaLauncher’s 
window, information about the progress of any currently executed function as well as 
information about its overall results (after the end of it) is displayed.  
3.10.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences 
PeaZip allows users to monitor at any time the progress and the status of any of its 
functions that is being executed, as well as displaying information about the results of 
those functions on the archive or file for which they were executed, information about 
the contents of those archives or files and information that have to do with the 
execution itself (like running time).

4.2 Hardware Interfaces 
For PeaZip’s installation and use, requirements are almost zero. It can run on any computer 
system, regardless of the type of operating system used. The only thing PeaZip requires, as far as 
hardware is concerned, is an x-86 compatible CPU, due to some performance critical sections 
written in ASM. 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 30 
 
 
4.3 Software Interfaces 
PeaZip is compatible with: 
 
• 
All 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows 
• 
All 32-bit Microsoft Windows(95/98/ΝΤ/2000/ΧP/Vista) 
• 
All POSIX(all versions of  Linux/all versions of BSD/all UNIX-like operating systems) 
 
Moreover, PeaZip is available as source code that is compatible with almost any operating system. 
It is obvious, that PeaZip is independent from the operating system of the computer system on 
which it runs. 
 
To conclude, all needed software invoked by the frontend is included in PeaZip packages 
(available under suitable licenses, as open source or royalty free) so no custom package is needed 
to be installed to make PeaZip work (with the possible exception of some standard gtk/gdk related 
libraries needed to run PeaZip, Gwrap and Pea binaries, which may be missing in some computer 
systems, but are well known, trustable and widely available). 
4.4 Communications Interfaces 
PeaZip is not a web application, thus its installation and use does not require any 
communication interfaces’ feature. However, connection to the Internet would be considered useful 
for users, as, through it, they would be able to access on-line help and information about PeaZip. 
5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements 
5.1 Performance Requirements 
Do not exist. 
5.2 Safety Requirements 
This application should function even in cases of wrong data insertion or wrong settings. In 
case of error it should provide users with appropriate help messages. 
5.3 Security Requirements 
Extraction (this feature is described in previous chapters)of the content of encrypted(locked) 
archives through PeaZip, shouldn’t be allowed without inserting the correct password and (if 
existing) keyfile for authentication. Moreover, recovering the password and the keyfile that one 
PeaZip user has inserted or set to an archive(this feature is described in previous chapters)by any 
other user of the computer system or the application, through the application itself or in general the 
computer system. Finally, no data remains from data that have been selected to be securely 
deleted should be left in the storing area of the computer system after the end of the procedure of 
secure deletion (described in previous chapter), in case of selection of this feature. 


Software Requirements Specification for PeaZip  
Page 31 
 
 
5.4 Software Quality Attributes 
Any user should be able to use PeaZip without any specific knowledge or experience over 
using computer systems, by reading user manuals(help documents, requirements specification 
document, mini tutorials) and seeing messages and warnings that the application provides with.
