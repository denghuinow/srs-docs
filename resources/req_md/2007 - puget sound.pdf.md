Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to capture, in natural language and at a functional level, the description 
and requirements of a new courseware system for the University of Puget Sound’s educational needs. 
This is a functional description of those features required to address current instructional and 
educational requirements. Each requirement is accompanies by a short discussion, designed to add the 
background and framework necessary to explain the functionality. It also describes nonfunctional 
requirements and other factors necessary to provide a complete and comprehensive description of the 
requirements for the software. 
1.2 
Scope 
This documents deals with the immediate requirements for the development of core functionality 
currently unavailable in Moodle, the existing courseware system candidate (version TODO: Version of 
Moodle). The University’s enhancements to Moodle will embody several small redesigns for consistency 
with other university practices. Additionally, the enhancements will take the opportunity to redesign the 
user interface to reflect a more natural flow of data. 
 
These requirements are based on the assumptions that Moodle will be adopted at the University of 
Puget Sound and that any enhancements to the system will utilize the existing APIs made available by 
Moodle.

1.5 
Overview 
This is a working document and, as such, is subject to change. In its initial form, it is incomplete by 
definition, and will require continuing refinement. Requirements may be modified and additional 
requirements may be added as development progresses and the system description becomes more 
distilled. 
 
This document also forms the basis for continuing discussions with stakeholders and sponsors, to 
enhance and further describe those requirements to be included in future enhancements to Moodle. 
This information will serve as a framework for the current definition and future evolution of the 
University of Puget Sound’s courseware system. 
2. 
Overall Description 
2.1 
Assumptions 
The University of Puget Sound is currently seeking a new courseware system and is investigating 
Moodle as an option. We are making an assumption that Moodle is of interest to the University 
as a viable choice to replace Blackboard. 
 
The goal of this document, and our work, however, is to determine what any courseware system 
would need to qualify as a viable solution for the University. We also intend to apply this 
document to Moodle to determine whether we can implement some of the features that 
Moodle lacks and our stakeholders find to be important. By no means is the University 
necessarily going to choose Moodle as a courseware system, but we want to use the platform to 
have a new learning experience and contribute back to a real product nonetheless. 
2.2 
Product Characteristics 
Moodle is courseware system that managers courses, assignments, wiki pages, forums, etc. Our 
goal is to refine parts of Moodle to provide functionality that improves the overall learning 
experience of students at the University and helps professors to make students aware of new 
ways of presenting material. 
 
At present, the University does not believe that Blackboard is providing the functionality that 
students and faculty need to encourage learning. Our stakeholder feedback was gathered to 
help us determine the requirements of a replacement courseware system and provide analysis 
of the feature set in other available solutions. 
2.3 
User Characteristics 
2.3.1 
Students 
Students are the primary consumers of a courseware system. They are accessing information 
posted by professors, uploading assignments and project files, and discussing concepts.  
2.3.2 
Professors 
Professors are the primary content administrators of a courseware system. They are uploading 
files, links, and multimedia, and grading assignments in addition to creating new places for

students to discuss and collaborate. 
2.3.3 
System Administrators 
System administrators are primarily responsible for maintaining the courseware system. They 
contribute minimally to the courses themselves, but spend more time modifying the system’s 
configuration and making appropriate updates. 
2.4 
Stakeholder Needs 
In order to determine what enhancements needed to be made to Moodle, we interviewed 
system stakeholders (e.g., professors and students) to determine what, if anything, is lacking in 
our existing courseware solution. Our requirements and supplementary requirements are based 
on that feedback which is summarized in Moodle Requirements Brainstorming.pdf (referenced 
in section 1.4.1). 
3. 
Specific Requirements 
The priorities defined below reflect the requirements of the development team. The goal was to define 
those requirements that describe the core functionality required to support and facilitate diverse 
methods of teaching at the University of Puget Sound. 
 
Requirements have been categorized according to the following definitions: 
 
Priority 1 (Core): Core functionality currently existing in Moodle/Blackboard. 
Priority 2: Functionality not explicitly available today, but considered critical to implementing a 
courseware system at the University. 
Priority 3: Just barely outside the parameters of Priority 2; considered very important to supplement 
critical functionality 
Priority 4: Outside the parameters of Priority 2; considered valuable as a supplement to other 
functionality, but not critical 
 
The initial production release of the University of Puget Sound’s enhancements to Moodle will deliver 
the Priority 1 (Core) and Priority 2 set of requirements, along with such Priority 3 requirements as can be 
developed within the project timeframe and budget constraints. 
3.1 
Multiple File Transfer 
The system must be able to capture and manage files where appropriate. 
 
One of the fundamental tasks of the system is to allow actors to upload and manage files on 
certain pages of the system. These might include assignment submission pages, forum pages, 
wiki pages, and announcement pages. An actor in the role of course administrator should be 
able to optionally upload multiple files where he or she finds that such as feature would be 
useful—such as on a devoted project page. 
 
For this requirement, page refers to any distinct upload point (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a 
forum post, etc.).  
 
Priority: 2

3.1.1 
The system must allow for multiple file upload to be configured on a per-page basis. 
Actors in the capacity of course administrator or professor should be able to enable multiple file 
uploads on a page of his or her choosing. For collaborative projects, it becomes important for 
actors to be able to upload more than one file to a given page, especially in the case of an 
assignment submission where the assignment might include multiple parts. Such a construct 
should be offered to the actor during a page’s creation and editing stages. 
3.2 
Audio Recording 
The system must be able to capture and organize voice clips that can be used where 
appropriate. 
 
One of the shortcomings of the current courseware system is that the foreign language 
department is unable to capture and track voice clips—recorded by students—for oral 
homework over the course of a student’s education.  
 
Priority: 2 
3.2.1 
The system must allow actors to organize their voice clips into a portfolio. 
Equal and finite drive space needs to be allotted to each actor in the role of professor or 
administrator to allow for the storing of voice clips recorded and submitted by all actors in the 
roles of students. Actors in the role of professor or system administrator should be allowed to 
partition this space for actors in the roles of students. This can be done one of two ways: 1) the 
actor can be allowed to preview the voice clip before it is archived and determine whether or 
not he or she would like that clip to be archived, or 2) a newly created voice clip can be 
automatically archived. The first option would allow the actor to throw out an audio clip that is 
deemed to be unsuitable or inappropriate for an assignment without having to take it out of an 
archive of voice clips. The actor should have the option to have the voice clip be archived after a 
preview has taken place. The second option would automatically archive a voice clip once 
submitted but would require that the actor interact with the archived file. Thus, if the actor 
chooses to delete the file, it would need to be deleted from the archive of voice clips.  
 
Maintaining an archive of voice clips makes it possible for comparisons to be made between 
clips to determine whether an actor is improving his or her language skills over multiple courses. 
The actor should be able to optionally attach one of his or her archived items to any page where 
uploads are permitted. 
 
The term archive used above may also be referred to as a portfolio. 
3.2.2 
The system must allow actors to download their voice clips in a flexible format. 
Voice clips should be optionally downloadable in a format such as MPEG Audio (mp3) format, 
since it is widely supported across different web browsers and operating systems. Voice clips 
should be downloadable for archival purposes or for the purpose of presenting them to other 
actors. 
3.2.3 
The system must store audio clips in a format conducive to speech. 
Voice clips should be stored in a format optimized for speech since this feature is meant to 
catalog voice recordings. Recordings should only be converted to MPEG Audio (mp3) format

when they are being downloaded; a separate viewer should be provided in a cross-platform 
language for listening to clips in Moodle. 
3.2.4 
The system must allow actors to delete recorded clips. 
Since voice clips should be stored in a portfolio for each actor during his or her existence in the 
course management system, he or she should be able to examine his or her portfolio to select 
and delete clips if he or she chooses to. This allows him or her to manage archived voice clips 
and to create a cohesive portfolio that actors in the role of professor can use to judge 
improvement over time. 
3.3 
Web Feeds 
The system must be able to display web feeds, such as RSS 2.0 feeds, for all pages of the course 
management system where elements such as forum posts, assignment postings, 
announcements, wiki alterations and other blocks of information that an actor may view are 
added. Actors in the role of course administrators should have the ability to determine which of 
these components have feeds and to whom these feeds should pertain. 
 
If actors are unable to be notified in some way of new content in Moodle, they are unable to 
efficiently keep track of a course’s current affairs. For this requirement, page refers to any 
distinct block (e.g., assignments, wikis, forum threads, etc.). 
 
Priority: 1 
 
3.3.1 
The system must allow web feeds to be turned on or off on a per-page basis. 
Actors in the course administrator role may not feel the need to provide web feeds for every 
page in their course. During the creation and editing of a page, that actor should be able to 
toggle web feed availability. 
3.4 
Search 
The system must be able to use search functionality as a way to navigate Moodle pages instead 
of using hierarchical links. 
 
Moodle can be difficult to navigate and requires too many clicks to be efficiently used. Too many 
steps to complete basic actions—such as submitting an assignment—lead to frustration on the 
part of the actor. A search utility enables actors to find what they are looking for quickly in 
addition to having a hierarchical approach to finding functions of the course management 
system. For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page, such as an assignment, a wiki 
page, or a forum post. 
 
Priority: 2 
 
3.4.1 
An actor must be able to search through pages in a course. 
Actors should be able to search for pages at the course level, since most actors will be searching 
for material in a given course. The search feature should be present in two ways.

First, it should be present in the form of a search box and a “Search” button on the top or 
bottom of every page. More information on this topic is given in sub-section 3.4.2 below.  
 
Second, a single page should be dedicated specifically to the task of searching the course 
management system. In addition to the basic search field, this page should allow an actor to 
filter out certain results (such as forum posts or grades, etc.) and search specific sections (or 
components) of the course management system. Results should appear in categories (e.g., 
Assignments, Wiki Pages, Forum Posts, etc.) based on relevance. In this case, relevance is 
determined by results that having the highest number terms matching the search terms. When 
the actor clicks a search result link, they should be taken to the page corresponding to the 
search result. 
 
In addition, the search page described above might allow for the possibility of searching the 
world wide web using a standard search engine such as Google. 
3.4.2 
The system must display a search box on every page after an actor has logged in. 
Actors should be able to search from any page. If the actor is hierarchically outside of a 
particular course, each of his or her courses should be searched and results should be grouped 
by course. If the actor is hierarchically inside of a course, that course should be searched with an 
option to search all courses. 
3.5 
Gradebook 
The system must allow actors in the capacity of course administrator to post grades associated 
with assignments for a particular actor in the capacity of student. Actors in the role of professor 
may want to optionally grade assignments online since they are being submitted electronically 
by actors in the role of student.  
 
Priority: 1 
3.5.1 
A course administrator must be able to grade an assignment. 
Course administrators should be able to post grades for an assignment based on the ratio of 
points earned to points possible. The course administrator should also be able to attach 
feedback in the form of text or an attachment (as described above). Time stamps should be 
attached to the last time the grade was modified so that actors may examine when particular 
grades were submitted and how an actor in the role of student has improved or lessened his 
performance in the course. 
3.5.2 
The system should display grade information to the appropriate actor. 
 
The system should display grade information such as the grade for each assignment, averages, 
and overall grade to the actor to whom the grades belong. No other actor should be able to 
view another’s grades except an actor in the role of course administrator for the course to 
which the grades belong. 
3.5.3 
The system should maintain a grade history. 
The system should maintain a history of grades for a particular assignment if the course 
administrator changes them. This way, another actor can review the grade information if their

score on an assignment has changed and they wish to dispute it. Course administrators can also 
track how they have changed a score over time using the timestamps associated with each 
change to the gradebook.  
3.6 
Social Networking Applications  
The social, collaborative components of Moodle are not very robust. There are better, freely-
available solutions which should be integrated into Moodle to provide the best functionality 
possible for all actors without having to use 3rd party services. 
 
Priority: 3 
 
3.6.1 
The system must provide a wiki where actors can collaboratively create networks of documents. 
A freely available wiki should provide a simple markup language that actors can use to style their 
input, as well as link to other pages in the wiki. More importantly, having the wiki inside Moodle 
reduces confusion and allows for the integration of notifications and logins. 
3.6.2 
The system must provide a blog engine. 
A freely available blog engine should provide all modern blog functionality, such as tagging, 
drafting, and comments. These blogs should share authentication and notification with Moodle. 
3.7 
Notifications 
Currently, there is no system that allows actors to receive SMS or email notifications of changes 
to Moodle pages (such as assignments or announcements). 
 
Priority: 3 
3.7.1 
The system must provide both e-mail and SMS notifications for pages. 
For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a forum 
post, etc.). When a page is created, the actor in the role of course administrator should be able 
to toggle whether notifications are turned on. By default, they should be turned on for 
announcements. If notifications are turned off, actors in the capacity of student should be able 
to subscribe to notifications. 
 
Students should be able to select in their preferences whether notifications are sent to their 
mobile telephone (via SMS) or e-mail account. They should also be able to manage their 
notification subscriptions (for example, remove themselves from notifications). 
4. 
General System Functional Requirements 
4.1 
Usability  
4.1.1 
As far as possible, the system should provide a simple, responsive interface. 
Although any courseware solution may be composed of diverse systems, applications, and 
processes, the underlying architecture should be transparent to the administrators. The system 
should be configurable from a single source at a central administrative position, and should 
provide a central, easy-to-use interface that will allow administrators to configure the user 
interface and features in a way that reduces page clutter.

Page 13 
 
 
A system will be considered to meet this requirement if it has a single administrative interface 
rather than individual links for editing each page. Furthermore, this interface must allow 
administrators to easily change themes and other setting that affect page layout across the 
entire courseware system. 
 
Priority: 3 
4.2 
Reliability  
4.2.1 
The system must be backed up on a configurable schedule. 
Back-up requirements will need to be determined, based on individual components of the 
system.  The system should be backed up with a frequency that ensures system and course data 
is protected. Since assignments will be submitted via the system, it should be backed up on a 
nightly basis, with options for weekly, off-site backup when necessary. 
 
The system must have the ability and capacity to restore back-up data within six hours so that 
the system is never offline for an inordinate period of time. 
 
Priority:  2 
4.2.2 
The system should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
This statement provides a general sense of system availability.  It is not intended to demand the 
system maintain reliability, or to require the system to be highly available.  It should not exclude 
maintenance windows, or scheduled downtime.  It is only intended to convey the expectation 
that our customers should have access to the system during off-hours as well as business hours. 
99% up-time should be considered sufficient to meet this requirement. 
 
Priority: 1   
4.3 
Performance 
4.3.1 
The system should support at least 1000 concurrent users. 
This statement provides a general sense of reliability when the system is under load. It is 
important that a substantial number of actors be able to access the system at the same time, 
since a courseware system is important to the courses that employ it. The times when the 
system will be under the most stress are likely during midterm and finals weeks. Therefore, it 
must be able to handle at least 1,000 concurrent users. 
 
Priority:  1 
4.4 
Supportability 
4.4.1 
The system must be maintainable without substantial modification. 
Due to limited staff in the Office of Information Services, it is important that the system be 
mostly self-sustaining. This will reduce the number of FTE hours spent maintaining the system 
and simplify maintenance tasks.
