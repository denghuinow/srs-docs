# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
The NLM Digital Repository aims to acquire, organize, preserve, and provide access to biomedical digital materials in various formats. It will support both digitized content from NLM's collections and born-digital resources while ensuring long-term preservation and accessibility. The scope covers collection materials under Library Operations responsibility, excluding resources like UMLS and Visible Human.

## Roles and User Stories
- **General Public User**: I want to search and view repository materials so that I can access biomedical information for research and education.
- **NIH Staff User**: I want to access restricted materials so that I can use them for NIH research and reference work.
- **NLM Metadata Staff**: I want to create and edit descriptive metadata so that materials are properly cataloged and discoverable.
- **NLM Preservation Staff**: I want to monitor technology changes so that I can develop migration strategies to prevent format obsolescence.
- **Content Producer**: I want to submit digital materials following agreed formats so that they can be preserved and made accessible through NLM.

## Key Processes
1. **Trigger: Content selection** - Materials are selected based on collection development policies and submission agreements.
2. **Receive Submission** - SIPs are accepted via electronic transfer or physical media with virus checking and validation.
3. **Quality Assurance** - Automated and manual validation ensures submitted materials meet repository standards.
4. **Generate AIP** - SIPs are transformed into Archival Information Packages conforming to repository standards.
5. **Store Content** - AIPs are transferred to archival storage with location tracking.
6. **Provide Access** - DIPs are generated and delivered to users based on access rights and restrictions.
7. **Monitor Preservation** - Ongoing technology and community monitoring informs preservation planning and migration strategies.

## Domain Data Elements
- **Digital Object**: UniqueID, Format, PermanenceLevel, AccessRights, FileSize
- **Descriptive Metadata**: MetadataID, Title, Author, Subject, Language, DateCreated
- **Submission Agreement**: AgreementID, Producer, ContentType, FormatRequirements, Schedule
- **Access Log**: LogID, UserID, ObjectID, AccessTime, AccessType
- **Preservation Event**: EventID, ObjectID, ActionType, Date, Outcome
- **Storage Location**: LocationID, ObjectID, MediaType, StoragePath, BackupStatus

## Non-functional Requirements
- Support for multiple languages and non-Roman scripts
- Compliance with HHS/NIH security standards and policies
- Audit trail maintenance for all system actions
- Disaster recovery capabilities including off-site backup
- Section 508 compliance for web accessibility
- Support for bulk operations and high-volume ingest

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- Evaluation and testing of commercial/open source software options
- Integration with NLM's Integrated Library System (ILS)
- Compatibility with NIH Consolidated Collocation Site (NCCS) for backup
- Development of migration strategies and methodologies policies
- Implementation of authentication and access management system

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Technology obsolescence**: Regular monitoring of emerging technologies and development of migration plans
- **Format incompatibility**: Acceptance of non-standard formats for important materials with future migration potential
- **Staff resource constraints**: Phased implementation approach and potential additional programming support
- **Access rights complexity**: Granular access control system with inheritance capabilities
- **Data corruption**: Multiple error checking mechanisms including CRCs and checksums

## Undecided Issues
- Specific migration strategies and methodologies
- Ingest policies including authorized staff and minimum requirements
- NLM DTD book format expansions and TEI adoption
- NLM metadata scheme revisions
- Web harvesting integration approach
- Specific preservation strategy implementation details
