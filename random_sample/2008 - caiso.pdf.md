# Ultra Short Summary
The plan ensures sufficient Black Start generation capability to restore the CAISO grid after a major blackout.

**MVP points**
- Annually verify the number, size, availability, and location of Black Start units meet WECC requirements.
- Conduct periodic Black Start capability tests for designated units.
- Maintain a database of all designated Black Start generators with key operational details.
- Train grid operators annually on system restoration procedures using Black Start units.

**Key constraints**
- Black Start units must self-start without external power and maintain voltage/frequency regulation.
- Testing must demonstrate unit capability to energize transmission paths and synchronize within specified time limits.
- The plan is reviewed and updated at least every five years.

**Major risks/undecided issues**
