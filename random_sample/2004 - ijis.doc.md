# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The Tarrant County Integrated Justice Information System (IJIS) aims to enhance justice administration through improved business processes and technology solutions. This phase focuses on defining requirements for managing indigent defense services, including attorney appointment, defendant representation, and compliance reporting. Non-goals include implementing non-criminal justice functions or replacing existing financial systems like SAP.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
**Key Roles:** Defendant, Magistrate, Defense Attorney, Office of Attorney Appointments, Judge, Court Coordinator
**Main Scenarios:** Submit/Process Request for Appointed Counsel, Manage Defendant Contact, Manage Attorney Compensation
**Exception Scenarios:** Defendant waiver of counsel, Attorney qualification failures, Payment disputes

## Business Process
**Main Process (Appointment):**
1. Arrest → Financial affidavit completion → Indigency hearing → Counsel request submission → Attorney selection → Notification
**Key Branch A (Waiver):** Defendant waives rights → Sign waiver → Submit to Office
**Key Branch B (Non-indigent):** Magistrate determines non-indigence → Submit denial notice

## Interfaces and Integrations
- Court Case Management System: Bidirectional, Case data exchange, Input: Defendant/charge details, Output: Appointment status, SLA: Real-time sync
- District Attorney ECFS: Inbound, Case filing decisions, Input: Charge acceptance/rejection, Output: Notification to attorneys, SLA: 24-hour notification
- Financial System (SAP): Outbound, Payment processing, Input: Approved payment orders, Output: Payment status, SLA: End-of-day batch
- Detention Facility System: Bidirectional, Defendant custody status, Input: Release updates, Output: Appointment notifications, SLA: 15-minute updates

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** a defendant has been arrested and qualifies as indigent  
**When** the magistrate submits the counsel request  
**Then** the system must assign an attorney within one working day

**Given** a defense attorney has been appointed  
**When** the district attorney files charges  
**Then** the system must notify the attorney and update case records within 24 hours

## Non-functional Metrics
- Performance: Process counsel requests within 4 hours, Generate reports under 2 minutes
- Reliability: 99.5% system availability, Zero data loss during integrations
- Security: Role-based access control, Audit trails for all financial transactions
- Compliance: Adherence to Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, TFID reporting standards

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Core appointment processing (Phase 1)
2. Integration with court systems (Phase 2)
3. Attorney management module (Phase 3)
4. Payment processing (Phase 4)
5. Reporting dashboard (Phase 5)
6. Full compliance reporting (Final)

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- Data integration failures: Implement robust error handling and manual override procedures
- Attorney qualification disputes: Establish clear appeal process with judicial oversight
- System performance degradation: Scale infrastructure based on case volume monitoring
- Compliance requirement changes: Maintain modular design for easy regulation updates

## Undecided Issues and Responsible Parties
- Electronic signature standards for affidavits (Office of Attorney Appointments)
