# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
The X-38 Fault Tolerant System Services (FTSS) provides fault-tolerant computing services for NASA's X-38 Crew Return Vehicle flight critical computer system. It enables quad-redundant Flight Critical Processors to operate as a single fault-tolerant virtual group while providing system services to application software. The scope includes scheduling, communication, fault detection, redundancy management, and system support services for both FCPs and Instrument Control Processors.

## Roles and User Stories
- **As a** flight control application developer, **I want** to schedule tasks at different rates **so that** vehicle control functions execute with proper timing.
- **As a** system integrator, **I want** fault detection and recovery services **so that** the system maintains operation through hardware failures.
- **As an** I/O subsystem developer, **I want** reliable communication services **so that** sensor data and actuator commands are exchanged reliably.
- **As a** mission controller, **I want** system health monitoring **so that** vehicle status can be assessed during flight.
- **As a** safety engineer, **I want** redundant processing **so that** single failures don't compromise vehicle safety.

## Key Processes
1. **System Initialization** (trigger: power-on reset) - Configures hardware into fault-tolerant computer system.
2. **Task Scheduling** (trigger: 50Hz timer interrupt) - Executes application tasks at defined rates.
3. **Fault Detection** (trigger: continuous monitoring) - Identifies hardware failures through built-in tests.
4. **Communication Services** (trigger: application requests) - Manages message passing between virtual groups.
5. **Redundancy Management** (trigger: fault detection) - Reconfigures system to mask failed components.
6. **Memory Management** (trigger: periodic/on-demand) - Performs memory scrubbing and alignment.
7. **System Support** (trigger: telemetry cycle) - Handles telemetry and command processing.

## Domain Data Elements
- **Virtual Group** (primary key: VG ID) - redundancy level, member processors, status, configuration
- **Task** (primary key: task ID) - rate group, priority, execution state, deadline
- **Message Queue** (primary key: queue ID) - sender VG, receiver VG, message buffer, status
- **Fault Log** (primary key: fault ID) - component type, error type, timestamp, recovery action
- **System Time** (primary key: time source) - MET, SEP, synchronization status, drift rate
- **Configuration Table** (primary key: table version) - VG mappings, timeout values, vote masks

## Non-functional Requirements
- System initialization completes within 1.5 minutes from power-on
- Fault masking occurs within 60 milliseconds of fault detection
- Memory scrubbing handles 10MB every 8 minutes using ≤1% CPU
- Telemetry data fits within 5000 bits/second budget
- All FCP software modules must be identical across redundant channels
- Processor synchronization maintained within 330 microseconds skew

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- Integration with NASA application software
- Compatibility with VxWorks 5.4 operating system
- Interface with Radstone PowerPC 604R hardware
- Coordination with Command & Telemetry Computer systems
- Validation with Network Element hardware

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Single point failures** - Mitigated through quad-redundant architecture and voting
- **Memory corruption** - Mitigated through EDAC and periodic scrubbing
- **Synchronization loss** - Mitigated through presence tests and resynchronization
- **Communication faults** - Mitigated through Byzantine-resilient protocols
- **Software exceptions** - Mitigated through task restart and error reporting
