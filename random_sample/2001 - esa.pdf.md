# Ultra Short Summary
The APAF ground data system processes ASPERA-3 instrument and Mars Express orbit/attitude telemetry into IDFS data products for scientific analysis and PDS archiving.

- MVP points
  - Acquire ASPERA-3 and Mars Express telemetry data from ESOC via NISN.
  - Process all science data into IDFS data sets for distribution and analysis.
  - Provide web-based displays of current data for public viewing and password-protected science analysis.
  - Archive telemetry and IDFS data locally and submit validated data to NASA PDS within 6 months.

- Key constraints
  - The system must operate on UNIX-based development and production computers with network connectivity.
  - Data delivery to Co-Is must occur within 24 hours of error-free telemetry acquisition.
  - Web server access must be password-protected to restrict sensitive data to authorized team members.

- Major risks/undecided issues
