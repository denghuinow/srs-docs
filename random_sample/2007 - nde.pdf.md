# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
The NDE system will process and distribute NPOESS satellite data to NOAA's operational and climate communities. It aims to generate tailored data products, archive NOAA-unique products, and provide customer services while supporting NPP and NPOESS satellite missions. The system will operate across Operational, Development, and Test environments.

## Roles and User Stories
- **Authorized Customer**: I want to subscribe to data products so that I receive automated deliveries
- **System Operator**: I want to monitor system health and performance so that I can maintain operational availability
- **Data Processor**: I want to execute scientific algorithms so that I can generate NOAA-unique products
- **Archive Manager**: I want to deliver products to CLASS so that they are preserved long-term
- **Help Desk Staff**: I want to track customer service requests so that I can resolve issues promptly

## Key Processes
1. **Trigger: Satellite data receipt** → Ingest data from IDPS and external sources
2. **Trigger: Data availability** → Execute scientific algorithms to generate products
3. **Trigger: Product generation** → Apply formatting and compression transformations
4. **Trigger: Customer subscriptions** → Distribute products to authorized users
5. **Trigger: Archive requirements** → Deliver NOAA-unique products to CLASS
6. **Trigger: System events** → Monitor performance and log statistics
7. **Trigger: Failure detection** → Execute automatic failover procedures

## Domain Data Elements
- **Data Product**: ProductID, Format, Compression, Projection, Metadata
- **Customer**: UserID, SubscriptionList, AuthorizationLevel, ContactInfo
- **Algorithm**: AlgorithmID, InputRequirements, ExecutionParameters, Version
- **System Log**: LogID, EventType, Timestamp, Severity, Component
- **Satellite Data**: DataID, Source, ReceiptTime, QualityFlags, Metadata
- **Archive Record**: ArchiveID, ProductReference, StorageLocation, RetentionPeriod

## Non-functional Requirements
- System availability: No more than 2 hours interruption in 24-hour period
- Data throughput: 4-16 TB/day depending on mission phase
- Product latency: Less than 5 minutes from data receipt to availability
- Security: Compliance with NOAA IT security standards
- Reliability: 99% successful execution of scheduled tasks
- Scalability: Capacity expansion without infrastructure redesign

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- NPP mission data processing capability
- Interface integration with IDPS and CLASS systems
- Compliance with Federal Enterprise Architecture
- Technology refresh cycles
- NPOESS satellite launch schedules

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Data volume growth**: Implement scalable architecture with additional capacity
- **System failures**: Provide automatic failover to test environment
- **Security breaches**: Follow ESPC security procedures and authorization protocols
- **Interface compatibility**: Maintain standardized interfaces with external systems
- **Technology obsolescence**: Plan for technology updates without system downtime

## Undecided Issues
- Specific data denial plan criteria for restricted access mode
- Complete list of customer-specified product formats
- Final grid spacing specifications for tailored products
- Detailed recovery time objectives for system restoration
- Exact thresholds for quality monitoring procedures
