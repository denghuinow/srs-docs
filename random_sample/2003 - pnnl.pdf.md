# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
This document specifies requirements for an automated diagnostic tool that detects faults in HVAC subsystems like chillers and cooling towers using sensed and fixed data. The tool aims to replace manual expert analysis with automated algorithms, providing fault identification, causes, and corrective actions to users such as building operators and service technicians. It supports both real-time and batch data processing, focusing initially on chiller and cooling tower diagnostics while allowing for future subsystem expansions.

## Roles and User Stories
- **Building Operator**: I want to monitor current diagnostic results so that I can quickly assess HVAC unit status during daily rounds.
- **Service Technician**: I want to view historical diagnostic data so that I can identify recurring faults during maintenance visits.
- **Energy Service Provider**: I want to configure multiple buildings remotely so that I can efficiently manage dispersed HVAC units.
- **Administrator**: I want to modify fixed data and diagnostic parameters so that I can adapt the system to specific equipment configurations.
- **General User**: I want to browse diagnostic results with simple navigation so that I can check system status without technical expertise.

## Key Processes
1. **Data Acquisition**: Triggered by sensor readings or file input; collects real-time or historical HVAC data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Filters and validates input data against expected ranges and converts units as needed.
3. **Equipment Status Determination**: Analyzes power/current data to determine if components like compressors or pumps are on/off.
4. **Fault Detection**: Applies diagnostic algorithms to identify specific performance or operational faults.
5. **Result Logging**: Stores diagnostic results with timestamps and metadata for historical tracking.
6. **User Notification**: Displays faults with descriptions, causes, and recommended fixes via the interface.
7. **Configuration Management**: Allows authorized users to adjust sensitivity settings and equipment parameters.

## Domain Data Elements
- **Building**: (Primary Key: BuildingID) Fields: Name, Location, ContactInfo, ScheduleType, MonitoringStatus
- **HVAC_Subsystem**: (Primary Key: SubsystemID) Fields: Type (Chiller/CoolingTower), Specifications, SetPoints, Capacity, FuelType
- **Sensor_Data**: (Primary Key: DataID) Fields: Timestamp, ParameterType, Value, Unit, ValidationStatus
- **Diagnostic_Result**: (Primary Key: ResultID) Fields: Timestamp, FaultType, Severity, Description, RecommendedAction
- **User**: (Primary Key: UserID) Fields: Role, AuthenticationLevel, ContactInfo, Preferences
- **Configuration**: (Primary Key: ConfigID) Fields: SensitivitySettings, AlarmThresholds, DataRanges, UnitConversions

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The system shall support concurrent monitoring of multiple buildings without performance degradation.
- User interfaces shall be intuitive enough for users with basic computer skills to operate with minimal training.
- Diagnostic algorithms must process data within 5 minutes of acquisition for real-time operation.
- The system shall log all errors with sufficient detail for technical support troubleshooting.
- Sensed data shall be stored with three significant figures precision for accuracy.
- Software shall be compatible with Microsoft Windows operating systems.

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- Completion of chiller and cooling tower diagnostic algorithms (Initial release milestone)
- Integration with data acquisition hardware from vendors like AEC Micrologger
- Development of boiler diagnostics module (Future expansion)
- User acceptance testing with building operators and service technicians
- Compliance with DOE and CEC documentation and reporting requirements

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Inaccurate sensor data**: Implement validation checks and user-configurable expected ranges.
- **Algorithm false positives/negatives**: Provide adjustable sensitivity settings and continuous algorithm refinement.
- **User authentication vulnerabilities**: Limit login attempts and automatically revert privileges after inactivity.
- **Hardware communication failures**: Log missing data events and provide clear error notifications.
- **System performance with large datasets**: Optimize data storage and retrieval methods for historical queries.
