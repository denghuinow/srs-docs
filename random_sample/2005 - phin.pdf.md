# Short Summary

- **Background and objectives**: The Public Health Information Network (PHIN) Outbreak Management system supports investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of health events or bioterrorism acts to identify and contain outbreaks effectively.

- **In scope**:
  - Case investigation and exposure contact tracing
  - Data collection for cases, contacts, specimens, lab results, and travel history
  - System integration and data exchange with partner systems
  - Analysis, visualization, and report generation
  - Flexible system architecture supporting configurable entities and relationships

- **Out of scope**:
  - Detailed countermeasure administration processes
  - Specific data transport and message construction mechanisms
  - Employee training and system backup procedures
  - Privacy and security implementation details
  - Vocabulary standards definition

- **Roles and core use cases**:
  - As an investigator, I want to trace exposure contacts so that I can identify at-risk populations.
  - As a public health official, I want to generate reports and visualizations so that I can monitor and analyze outbreak data.
  - As a laboratory user, I want to link specimen results to cases so that I can support accurate diagnosis and response.

- **Success metrics**:
  - Ability to exchange laboratory results and case data with partner systems
  - Accurate linking of entities, exposures, and laboratory data
  - Effective generation of aggregated reports and visualizations

- **Major constraints**:
  - Must use standardized vocabularies and data structures where available
  - Must support multiple deployment options (e.g., client-server, disconnected mode)
  - Must ensure data synchronization across system instances
  - Must protect data from unauthorized access and corruption
  - Must comply with jurisdictional reporting requirements

- **Undecided issues**:
  - Specific protocols for agent-specific deployment packages
  - Processes for determining when monitoring shifts from contact tracing to countermeasure administration
  - Configuration management details for field devices
