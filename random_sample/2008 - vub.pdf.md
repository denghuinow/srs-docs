# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The Publications Management System (PMS) is designed to manage a database with bibliographical information and store publication texts in PDF and PostScript formats. It supports automatic extraction of bibliographic data from full texts with manual correction capabilities and recognizes author/institute aliases. The system provides web and command-line access with role-based permissions. Non-goals include support for MS Word format, audio/video file management, and automatic author/institute disambiguation in the initial versions.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **Guest**: Register account, login, validate account, retrieve password
- **VUB-Network User**: All guest functions plus search publications, view results, download publications
- **Member**: All VUB-network functions plus change account details, logout
- **Publisher**: All member functions plus upload publications, edit own publications, bulk upload
- **Moderator**: All publisher functions plus manage user levels, edit departmental publications, manage group permissions
- **Administrator**: All moderator functions plus create/delete users/groups, edit all publications, system configuration

## Business Process
**Main Publication Search Process:**
1. User accesses system (trigger: user request)
2. System authenticates/identifies user role
3. User enters search criteria (input: keywords, authors, dates)
4. System queries database
5. System displays results list (output: publication titles/authors)
6. User selects publication for details
7. System shows detailed publication information
8. User downloads/views full text

**Key Branch - Publication Upload:**
1. Publisher logs in
2. Selects upload function
3. Provides document in supported format
4. System extracts bibliographic data
5. Publisher reviews/edits extracted data
6. System stores publication

## Domain Model
- **User**: username (unique, required), password (required, encrypted), email (required), role (required), department (reference)
- **Publication**: title (required), authors (required), publication_date, abstract, full_text (reference), format
- **Author**: name (required), first_name, institute (reference), aliases
- **Institute**: name (required, unique), aliases
- **Group**: name (required, unique), permissions, department (reference)
- **Reference**: citation_text (required), publication (reference), format
- **Search**: criteria, results, user (reference)
- **Department**: name (required, unique), moderators (reference)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **Web Browser**: Outbound, HTTP/TCP-80, XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliance, user input forms, rendered web pages, W3C standards compliance
- **MySQL Database**: Inbound, SQL queries, publication/user data storage, query results, concurrent access handling
- **Command Line**: Inbound, shell commands, administrative functions, command output, local VUB-network access only
- **Email System**: Outbound, SMTP, account validation/notifications, validation links, delivery confirmation

## Acceptance Criteria
**Publication Search:**
- Given a VUB-network user with valid connection, when they enter search criteria, then the system returns matching publications with titles and main authors

**User Registration:**
- Given a guest user with valid email, when they complete registration form, then the system sends validation email and creates pending account

**Publication Upload:**
- Given a publisher with supported document, when they upload publication, then the system extracts bibliographic data and allows manual correction before storage

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Support multiple concurrent database requests; TBD response time requirements
- **Reliability**: 24/7 availability excluding Wilma server downtime; automatic error logging and notification
- **Security**: Password encryption in transit and storage; strict role-based access control
- **Compliance**: W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard; IEEE SRS documentation standards
- **Observability**: Comprehensive error logging; user-friendly error messages with technical details for administrators

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. First iteration: Basic functions (critical requirements)
2. Second iteration: Enhanced functions (sufficient requirements)
3. Optional features implementation (if time permits)
4. Quality assurance review completion
5. Deployment to Wilma server
6. Post-deployment maintenance and support

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Database corruption**: Regular backups and restoration procedures
- **Authentication bypass**: Strong password encryption and role validation
- **Performance degradation**: Modular design for easy optimization
- **Format compatibility issues**: Limited to PDF/PS initially with clear documentation
- **User adoption challenges**: Simple, intuitive interface design
- **Server dependency**: Wilma availability contingency planning
- **Data extraction errors**: Manual correction capabilities provided
- **Security breaches**: Restricted CLI access and encrypted data storage
