# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The XML Services (XS) functional area provides infrastructure services for mission and support applications using XML technology within the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment. It enables registration of XML terms and structures, design of XML schemas, and generation/consumption of XML documents to ensure interoperability across defense systems. The services isolate vendor-unique implementations and provide data management functions for distributed database access. Non-goals include personnel training requirements and detailed implementation specifications, which are deferred to system developers.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **Producer**: Submits metadata and information resources to XML Registry
- **Consumer**: Discovers and reuses registered XML tags and structures
- **Manager**: Administrates registry content and user permissions
- **Data Manager**: Manages database architectures and platforms
- **Network Resource Manager**: Handles infrastructure resource management
- **COE Chief Engineer**: Approves points of contact and mediates disputes

Main scenarios include metadata submission, tag discovery and reuse, schema design validation, and XML document generation. Exception scenarios involve communication degradation handling and submission rejection workflows.

## Business Process
**Main Process: XML Resource Registration (8 steps)**
1. Producer downloads Information Resource Submittal Package
2. Producer completes XML Tag Specification forms
3. Producer submits metadata and artifacts via email/FTP
4. System parses submitted specification forms
5. System populates XML Registry database
6. Manager reviews and approves submission
7. System notifies community of changes
8. Resource becomes available for consumer discovery

**Key Branch: Submission Rejection (4 steps)**
- Trigger: Manager rejection decision
- Manager annotates rejection reasons
- System notifies producer of rejection
- Producer may modify and resubmit

## Domain Model
- **XML_Element** (name: required/unique, definition: required, status: required)
- **XML_Attribute** (name: required, element_reference: required)
- **XML_Spec** (spec_id: required/unique, type: required)
- **Domain** (domain_id: required/unique, valid_values: required)
- **XML_Namespace** (namespace_id: required/unique, reference: required)
- **Model** (model_id: required/unique, formalism_type: required)
- **Catalog** (catalog_id: required/unique, rules: required)
- **Document** (doc_id: required/unique, resource_type: required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **XML Registry API**: External, bidirectional, metadata submission and retrieval
- **Database Management Systems**: Internal, bidirectional, data access and management (Sybase, Oracle, Informix)
- **Management Services**: Internal, bidirectional, system/network/security administration
- **Distribution Services**: Internal, bidirectional, data interchange and distributed computing
- **Communications Services**: Internal, bidirectional, network services integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given a producer has completed submission forms, when they submit to registry, then system should parse and populate database
- Given a consumer searches for XML tags, when they specify search criteria, then system should return matching resources
- Given a manager reviews submission, when they approve/reject, then system should update status and notify parties
- Given degraded communications, when session timeout values are reset, then system should maintain operations

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Support varying workloads in fixed/dynamic environments; user-definable session timeouts
- **Reliability**: Operate in degraded communications environments; portable across COE-compliant platforms
- **Security**: Adhere to DOD data standards conventions; support discretionary access controls
- **Compliance**: Conform to COE architecture requirements; follow MIL-STD and FIPS standards

## Milestones and Release Strategy
- COE compliance validation
- XML Registry deployment
- Producer/consumer onboarding
- Integration with DBMS environments
- Federation agreement implementation
- Training environment setup

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Tag proliferation**: Establish naming conventions and review processes
- **Semantic inconsistency**: Implement validation rules and coordination processes
- **Communication degradation**: Provide dynamic session management capabilities
- **Platform compatibility**: Ensure portability across COE-compliant systems
- **Data model conflicts**: Monitor changes and mediate through COE Chief Engineer
- **Submission quality**: Implement review/approval workflows with annotation capabilities
