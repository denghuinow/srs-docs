# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The DigitalHome (DH) system is a smart home management prototype being developed by HomeOwner Inc.'s DigitalHomeOwner Division. It enables users to monitor and control home environmental systems including temperature, humidity, security, and appliance power states through web interfaces. The scope is limited to a prototype version for business decision-making, operating in a simulated environment without physical homes or devices. Non-goals include commercial deployment and integration with actual physical hardware systems.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **General User**: Monitors and controls home environment via web interface; familiar with basic web operations
- **Master User**: Has additional configuration rights including user account management and parameter changes
- **DH Technician**: Sets up and maintains system configuration with full system access rights

Main scenarios include environmental monitoring, device control, security management, and planning. Exception scenarios cover system failures, security breaches, and manual overrides.

## Business Process
**Main Process (Environmental Control):**
1. User logs into DH web interface
2. System displays current environmental status
3. User selects device type (thermostat/humidistat/appliance)
4. User views current readings or sets new parameters
5. System validates parameters and sends commands
6. Gateway transmits wireless signals to devices
7. Devices execute commands
8. System confirms execution and updates status

**Key Branch (Security Breach):**
- Contact sensor detects breach → System activates alarms → Logs breach event → Notifies user via interface

**Key Branch (Manual Override):**
- User manually changes device setting → Setting remains until planned period end → System resumes scheduled settings

## Domain Model
- **User Account** (username: required/unique, password: required, role: required)
- **Thermostat** (location: required, currentTemp: required, setPoint: required, schedule: reference)
- **Humidistat** (location: required, currentHumidity: required, setPoint: required, schedule: reference)
- **Contact Sensor** (location: required, status: required, alarmEnabled: required)
- **Power Switch** (appliance: required, state: required, schedule: reference)
- **Monthly Plan** (month: required, year: required, dailySettings: required)
- **System Configuration** (backupTime: required, defaultParams: required)
- **Security Alarm** (type: required, status: required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **DH Web Server** (Internal, Bidirectional): User interface for monitoring/control; Input: user commands; Output: system status; SLA: 2-second updates
- **Gateway Device** (Internal, Bidirectional): Wireless communication hub; Input: device commands; Output: sensor data; SLA: 1000ft range
- **Simulated Environment** (External, Bidirectional): Device simulation; Input: control signals; Output: sensor readings; SLA: 10Hz data acquisition
- **Backup System** (Internal, Outbound): Data protection; Input: system data; Output: backup files; SLA: Daily automated backup

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** a logged-in user **when** setting thermostat temperature **then** system validates range (60-80°F) and updates set point
- **Given** security system is armed **when** contact sensor opens **then** alarms activate and breach is logged
- **Given** monthly plan exists **when** user requests report **then** system provides averages, extremes, and breach history

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Environmental displays update every 2 seconds; 10Hz minimum sensor data acquisition
- **Reliability**: Maximum 1 failure per 10,000 hours; daily automated backup and recovery
- **Security**: Authentication via username/password; data encryption using Transport Layer Security
- **Compliance**: Adherence to ASHRAE standards and IEEE development standards

## Milestones and Release Strategy
- Requirements Complete (10/27/2010)
- Architecture Complete (11/15/2010)
- Construction Cycles (12/15/2010 - 5/16/2011)
- System Testing (6/20/2011)
- Acceptance Testing (7/14/2011)
- Postmortem Analysis (8/1/2011)

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Schedule Compression**: Use iterative development with six construction cycles
- **Cost Overruns**: Employ widely available technology and conduct price comparisons
- **System Reliability**: Implement comprehensive exception handling and backup mechanisms
- **Technical Complexity**: Use object-oriented development with UML 2.0 standards
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Implement authentication and encryption protocols
- **Maintenance Challenges**: Follow IEEE standards and comprehensive documentation
