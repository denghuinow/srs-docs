# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) is developing a Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) Data Use Analysis and Processing (DUAP) System as a research prototype to evaluate how VII data impacts transportation safety, operations, and asset management. The system will collect, consolidate, convert, and communicate vehicle probe data integrated with other transportation data sources to enhance MDOT's operational capabilities. Non-goals include full production deployment and operational use, as this is primarily a demonstration system for research and evaluation purposes.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
**Key Roles:** Transportation Agency Operators, Maintainers, Asset Managers, System Administrators, Travelers, Emergency Services
**Main Scenarios:** 
- Collecting probe vehicle data from multiple sources including VII POC and telematics fleets
- Processing data to detect incidents and calculate travel times
- Publishing traffic and weather alerts to operational systems
- Browsing traffic information via web interfaces
**Exception Scenarios:** 
- Handling data quality issues from vehicle sensors
- Managing privacy concerns with anonymized vehicle data

## Business Process
**Main Process (Data Collection to Publication):**
1. Receive probe data from vehicles via VII network (Trigger: Vehicle-RSE communication)
2. Collect supplementary traffic/weather data from external systems
3. Cache incoming data in dynamic storage with geo-reference and timestamp
4. Apply computational algorithms to derive operational information
5. Archive processed data for long-term storage
6. Format output for external systems and presentations
7. Publish alerts and information to stakeholders
8. Present data through web browsers and other interfaces

**Key Branches:**
*Data Quality Checking:* Validate incoming data → Flag questionable records → Apply correction algorithms → Route to appropriate processing
*Administrative Configuration:* Authenticate administrator → Modify service parameters → Update system configuration → Log changes

## Domain Model
**Key Entities:**
- ProbeData (required: timestamp, location; unique: segmentNumber)
- TrafficData (required: speed, location; reference: roadway segments)
- WeatherData (required: temperature, conditions; unique: stationID)
- Incident (required: location, severity; reference: probeData)
- RoadCondition (required: surfaceStatus, location)
- User (required: username; unique: userID)
- Configuration (required: parameterName, value)
- Archive (required: dataType, timestamp; reference: source systems)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **VII POC System** (Inbound): Probe data collection via X-031 interface / Input: Vehicle sensor data / Output: Processed traffic information / SLA: Near real-time
- **MITS Center** (Inbound): Traffic data collection / Input: Speed, volume, occupancy / Output: Integrated traffic conditions / SLA: Continuous feed
- **Clarus Weather** (Inbound): Weather data collection / Input: Atmospheric conditions / Output: Road weather alerts / SLA: Regular updates
- **TMS Systems** (Outbound): Traffic information publication / Input: Processed traffic data / Output: Operational alerts / SLA: Event-driven
- **Web Browsers** (Outbound): Presentation services / Input: Formatted data / Output: Interactive maps and tables / SLA: User-initiated

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** probe vehicle data is available from VII POC, **when** the system processes the data, **then** it shall derive speed and travel time information.

**Given** weather data exceeds threshold conditions, **when** the computational services run, **then** the system shall generate appropriate weather alerts.

**Given** an authorized system administrator, **when** they modify service configuration, **then** the changes shall be logged and applied without system disruption.

## Non-functional Metrics
**Performance:** Process incoming probe data with latency under 5 minutes; Support concurrent access by 50+ users
**Reliability:** Maintain 99% uptime during operational hours; Cache data for 1 week minimum
**Security:** Restrict access to authorized users only; Log all user access and data transactions
**Compliance:** Conform to MDIT IT standards; Use Michigan Geographic Framework references

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Core data collection services implementation
2. Computational algorithms development and testing
3. Output and presentation services integration
4. External system interface deployment
5. User acceptance testing with stakeholders
6. Research evaluation and demonstration phase

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- Data privacy concerns: Implement strict anonymization and data handling policies
- Data quality variability: Incorporate data validation and quality checking algorithms
- System integration complexity: Use service-oriented architecture for modular development
- Stakeholder adoption: Conduct regular demonstrations and training sessions
- Network latency issues: Design for near real-time processing expectations
- Changing requirements: Maintain flexible, extensible service architecture
