# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
This document specifies requirements for an automated diagnostic tool that detects faults in HVAC system components, specifically chillers and cooling towers. The software automates manual diagnostic processes previously performed by human experts through visual data analysis. It is being developed for Architectural Energy Corporation (AEC) with funding from the California Energy Commission and the U.S. Department of Energy. The tool targets building operators, service technicians, energy service providers, and operator supervisors. Non-goals include boiler diagnostics in the initial version and user-defined analysis of diagnostic results.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **General User**: Can browse current/historical diagnostics only
- **Administrator**: Can start/stop diagnostics, configure parameters, modify fixed data
- **Use Cases**: Start/Stop Diagnostics, Browse Current Diagnostics, Browse Historical Diagnostics, Configure Diagnostics, Authenticate User

## Business Process
**Main Process (Diagnostic Operation)**
1. Launch application and authenticate user
2. Start diagnostic processing
3. Acquire sensed data from HVAC units
4. Preprocess data (filtering, validation, unit conversion)
5. Execute diagnostic algorithms for fault detection
6. Store results with timestamps
7. Display current results via hierarchical interface
8. Allow historical results browsing

**Key Branches**
- **Configuration**: Admin modifies system parameters, sensitivity settings, equipment definitions
- **Historical Analysis**: Users browse past results with time period selection and zoom capabilities

## Domain Model
- **Building** (required: identifier)
- **Subsystem** (required: type, reference Building)
- **Diagnostic Result** (required: timestamp, fault type, reference Subsystem)
- **Sensed Data** (required: timestamp, value, unit, reference Subsystem)
- **Fixed Data** (required: specification values, setpoints, schedules)
- **User** (required: username, password, role)
- **Configuration** (required: sensitivity settings, thresholds)
- **Fault Definition** (required: description, causes, recommended fixes)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **Data Acquisition Systems**: Input direction, provides sensed HVAC data, requires real-time data streaming, SLA: continuous availability during operation
- **User Interface**: Bidirectional, provides diagnostic results and configuration, requires responsive display updates, SLA: sub-second response for user actions
- **Data Storage**: Output direction, stores diagnostic results and configuration, requires persistent storage, SLA: 99.9% availability
- **Authentication System**: Bidirectional, validates user credentials, requires secure authentication, SLA: immediate response

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given the system is running with valid HVAC data, when diagnostic processing is active, then faults are detected and displayed in real-time
- Given an administrator is authenticated, when configuration parameters are modified, then changes take effect immediately in diagnostic processing
- Given historical data exists, when a user selects a time period, then corresponding diagnostic results are displayed with correct fault indicators

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Process diagnostic algorithms within 5 seconds of data acquisition; support concurrent monitoring of up to 50 HVAC units
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime during scheduled operation periods; automatic recovery from sensor communication failures
- **Security**: Role-based access control with encrypted authentication; audit logging of all configuration changes
- **Compliance**: Adherence to California Energy Commission reporting requirements; IEEE software standards compliance

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Complete chiller diagnostics implementation
2. Integrate cooling tower diagnostics
3. Develop and validate user interface
4. Conduct field testing with pilot users
5. Deploy initial version to AEC
6. Plan boiler diagnostics for future release

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Incomplete sensor data**: Implement data validation and missing data handling procedures
- **False positive fault detection**: Include configurable sensitivity levels and validation periods
- **User interface complexity**: Conduct usability testing with actual building operators
- **System integration failures**: Develop robust communication protocols with data acquisition systems
- **Algorithm accuracy**: Validate diagnostic algorithms against expert manual analysis
- **Performance degradation with multiple units**: Implement efficient data processing and caching
- **Security breaches**: Implement secure authentication and data encryption
- **Maintenance complexity**: Design modular architecture for easy updates and extensions
