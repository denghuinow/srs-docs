# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The National Library of Medicine requires a robust digital repository to fulfill its mission of acquiring, organizing, preserving, and providing access to biomedical literature in all formats. This repository will manage digitized and born-digital materials from NLM collections, supporting long-term preservation and access. The scope includes materials under Library Operations responsibility, excluding resources like UMLS and Visible Human that fall outside this purview. Non-goals include web harvesting functionality and maintaining special access software for users.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **General Public**: Search and view materials with potential restrictions based on licensing, copyright, or location
- **NIH Staff**: Enhanced access privileges for research and reference purposes
- **NLM Metadata Staff**: Create, review, and edit descriptive metadata without modifying objects
- **NLM Object Maintenance Staff**: Perform quality checks, format conversions, and file manipulations
- **NLM System Administrators**: Manage system configuration, assign user rights, and perform development
- **Content Producers/Donors**: Submit materials through negotiated agreements

## Business Process
**Main Ingest Process (8 steps):**
1. Material selection and format preparation
2. Submission agreement negotiation
3. Receive SIP via electronic transfer or physical media
4. Quality assurance (virus checking, format validation)
5. Content review and approval/rejection
6. Generate AIP conforming to repository standards
7. Extract and validate descriptive metadata
8. Coordinate updates to archival storage and data management

**Key Branches:**
- **Rejection Handling**: Notify producer, record rejection reasons, prevent resubmission for certain criteria
- **Format Conversion**: Upgrade file versions or convert between formats while preserving intellectual content

## Domain Model
- **Digital Object** (UID: required/unique, PermanenceLevel: required, Format: required)
- **Submission Information Package** (Producer: required, SubmissionDate: required)
- **Archival Information Package** (StorageLocation: required, CreationDate: required)
- **Metadata Record** (Title: required, Identifier: required/unique, Rights: required)
- **User Account** (UserID: required/unique, AccessLevel: required)
- **Submission Agreement** (AgreementID: required/unique, Terms: required)
- **Preservation Plan** (PlanID: required/unique, MigrationStrategy: required)
- **Access Log** (LogID: required/unique, UserID: reference, Timestamp: required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **Integrated Library System**: Bidirectional, metadata synchronization, bibliographic data input, holdings updates
- **NIH Backup Facility**: Outbound, disaster recovery, data transfer for backup, storage synchronization
- **Public Access Interface**: Inbound, web-based search and retrieval, query input, DIP delivery
- **Content Producer Systems**: Inbound, SIP submission, file transfer, submission status
- **Authentication System**: Bidirectional, user verification, access token exchange, permission validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** a validated SIP from an approved producer, **when** ingest process completes, **then** AIP is stored and metadata is searchable
- **Given** a user with appropriate access rights, **when** searching repository content, **then** relevant results display with access-controlled delivery
- **Given** obsolete storage media, **when** migration triggered, **then** content transfers to new media without data loss
- **Given** restricted content, **when** unauthorized access attempted, **then** system denies access and logs attempt

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Support concurrent user searches with sub-second response times; handle bulk ingest of terabyte-scale collections
- **Reliability**: 99.9% system availability; automated disaster recovery with NCCS compatibility
- **Security**: HHS/NIH security standards compliance; granular access controls at object level
- **Compliance**: OAIS reference model adherence; copyright and licensing requirement enforcement
- **Observability**: Comprehensive audit trails for all actions; system performance monitoring and reporting

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Commercial and open source software evaluation
2. Policy development for migration strategies and ingest requirements
3. System architecture design and security framework implementation
4. Pilot implementation with selected collection materials
5. Staff training and workflow integration
6. Full production deployment with phased collection migration

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Format Obsolescence**: Regular technology monitoring and proactive migration planning
- **Resource Constraints**: Phased implementation and external funding pursuit
- **Policy Gaps**: Early development of preservation and ingest policies
- **System Integration**: API-based architecture and standardized protocols
- **Content Volume**: Scalable storage architecture and automated processing
- **Rights Management**: Flexible access control system and legal review processes
- **Data Corruption**: Multiple checksum verification and redundant storage
- **Staff Expertise**: Training programs and knowledge transfer documentation
