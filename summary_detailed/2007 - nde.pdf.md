# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The NPOESS Data Exploitation (NDE) system will process and distribute environmental satellite data from NPP and NPOESS missions to NOAA's operational and climate communities. Its primary mission includes generating tailored data products, archiving NOAA-unique products to CLASS, and providing customer support services. The system will operate across Operational, System Test, and Development environments. Non-goals include handling non-NPOESS satellite data and direct public data distribution without authorization.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **System Operator**: Monitors system health, manages task execution, handles trouble tickets
- **Customer**: Subscribes to data products, retrieves products, checks order status
- **Algorithm Developer**: Integrates scientific algorithms into processing system
- **Government Approver**: Authorizes subscription requests and data access
- **IDPS Interface**: Provides satellite data and telemetry to NDE
- **CLASS System**: Archives long-term data products

Main scenarios: Product subscription approval, data processing workflow, system failover
Exception scenarios: Degraded operations mode, data integrity failures, restricted access activation

## Business Process
**Main Process (Data Product Generation)**
1. Receive data from IDPS (Trigger: satellite data availability)
2. Validate input data integrity
3. Execute scientific algorithms
4. Generate tailored data products
5. Apply compression/formats per customer specifications
6. Distribute to authorized users
7. Archive NOAA-unique products to CLASS
8. Update performance statistics

**Key Branch A (Degraded Operations)**
1. Receive degraded mode notification from NPOESS
2. Consult government on product priorities
3. Generate subset of high-priority products
4. Notify affected customers

**Key Branch B (Product Recovery)**
1. Detect missing/corrupt input data
2. Submit ad-hoc requests to IDPS/CLASS
3. Reprocess products within shelf-life constraints
4. Deliver recovered products

## Domain Model
- **Data Product** (product_id: unique, metadata: required, format_type: required)
- **Customer** (customer_id: unique, authorization_level: required, subscription_list: required)
- **Algorithm** (algorithm_id: unique, version: required, execution_parameters: required)
- **Processing Task** (task_id: unique, schedule: required, priority: required, status: required)
- **System Log** (log_id: unique, timestamp: required, event_type: required, severity: required)
- **Subscription** (subscription_id: unique, customer_id: reference, product_type: required)
- **Archive Record** (record_id: unique, product_id: reference, archive_date: required)
- **Interface Connection** (connection_id: unique, system_name: required, status: required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **IDPS**: Inbound, Satellite data and telemetry reception, Input: xDR products, Output: Data delivery reports, SLA: Real-time delivery
- **CLASS**: Bidirectional, Long-term archiving, Input: NOAA-unique products, Output: Archived data retrieval, SLA: 100% receipt acknowledgment
- **MMC**: Outbound, Mission coordination, Input: Service requests, Output: Status inquiries, SLA: Specified in ICD
- **ESPC Trouble Ticket**: Inbound, Operational issue tracking, Input: Problem reports, Output: Resolution status, SLA: 2-hour response
- **Customer Distribution**: Outbound, Product delivery, Input: Formatted products, Output: Delivery confirmations, SLA: <5 minute latency
- **Ancillary Data Sources**: Inbound, External data acquisition, Input: Meteorological data, Output: Processing inputs, SLA: Daily updates

## Acceptance Criteria
**Product Generation**
- Given all required xDRs are ingested, When product generation executes, Then tailored products are available within 5 minutes

**System Failover**
- Given operational environment failure, When failover activates, Then test environment delivers products within same latency parameters

**Data Subscription**
- Given customer subscription request, When government approval provided, Then customer receives authorized products

**Quality Monitoring**
- Given input data quality thresholds, When monitoring executes, Then anomalies are detected and reported

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: 4-16 TB/day processing capacity depending on mission phase; <5 minute product latency
- **Reliability**: 99% scheduled task completion over 30 days; <4 hours monthly downtime per capability
- **Security**: Compliance with NOAA IT Security Manual; Role-based data authorization
- **Compliance**: Federal Enterprise Architecture conformance; FGDC metadata standards
- **Observability**: 90-day performance log retention; Custom report generation capability

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. System Requirements Specification completion
2. Development Environment establishment
3. System Test Environment validation
4. NPP mission operational readiness
5. NPOESS C1 mission capability expansion
6. Full operational capability with all mission support

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
1. **IDPS interface instability**: Implement redundant communication paths and retry mechanisms
2. **Data volume scalability**: Design modular infrastructure with capacity expansion capability
3. **Algorithm integration complexity**: Establish standardized algorithm packaging and testing procedures
4. **Security compliance**: Regular security audits and adherence to NOAA security manuals
5. **Schedule compression**: Phased delivery approach with parallel development streams
6. **Technology obsolescence**: Use COTS/open source with vendor-supported upgrade paths
7. **Operator error**: Comprehensive training and automated procedure validation
8. **Natural disaster recovery**: Business continuity plan with Wallops Island backup site
