# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
GOG (Gaia Object Generator) is a software simulator designed to produce catalog data, auxiliary data, and intermediate main database data for all Gaia instruments without relying on GASS telemetry, GIBIS, or the main ESAC database. It uses error models to rapidly simulate large datasets, with realism dependent on available error models. The system supports two source generation options: Universe Model from GaiaSimu library or user-provided object catalogs. Non-goals include simulating raw data or detailed instrumental noise effects, which are handled by GIBIS instead.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **Scientific User**: Configures simulations, selects noise models, requests specific data outputs
- **System Administrator**: Deploys GOG on cluster/grid environments, manages execution
- **Data Consumer**: Uses generated catalog and MDB data for analysis

Main scenarios include generating universe model catalog data, epoch data for individual transits, and combined data from multiple transits. Exception scenarios involve handling invalid configuration files and processing objects with missing transit information.

## Business Process
**Main Process (8 steps):**
1. Trigger: User executes GOG with configuration file
2. Initialization module loads configuration and source data
3. Determine requested output type (epoch/combined/both)
4. For epoch data: calculate transit parameters per source
5. For combined data: aggregate data across all transits
6. Apply selected noise models (instrumental/reduction)
7. Generate spectrum data (RP/BP and RVS)
8. Output module writes results in specified formats

**Key Branches:**
- Source Generation (4 steps): Select Universe Model or input catalog → Define sky region → Generate source list → Validate sources
- Noise Application (3 steps): User selects noise types → Apply instrumental errors → Apply reduction errors

## Domain Model
- **Source** (required: id, position; unique: id)
- **Transit** (required: source_id, timestamp; reference: Source)
- **EpochData** (required: transit_id, field_angles, magnitude)
- **CombinedData** (required: source_id, parallax, proper_motion)
- **Spectrum** (required: source_id, type, wavelengths, fluxes)
- **Configuration** (required: parameters, output_spec)
- **NoiseModel** (required: type, parameters)
- **OutputFile** (required: format, location, timestamp)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **GaiaSimu Library** (inbound): Universe model data, instrument models; Input: sky regions, source parameters; Output: source catalog; SLA: Data consistency
- **Main Database** (outbound): Catalog and MDB format data; Input: processed source data; Output: formatted files; SLA: ICD compliance
- **Cluster/Grid Environment** (bidirectional): Job execution; Input: configuration; Output: results; SLA: Platform independence

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given a valid configuration file with Universe Model source, when GOG executes, then it should generate catalog data following Universe Model ICD
- Given a source with multiple transits, when combined data is requested, then it should compute proper motion and parallax with error estimates
- Given noise models are disabled, when processing identical inputs, then outputs should be identical across executions

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Process one complete source within 2 CPU seconds; Generate data for 20% of expected final catalog
- **Reliability**: Platform-independent results across Linux, UNIX, MAC
- **Security**: Not mentioned
- **Compliance**: Output formats compliant with MDB and Universe Model ICDs
- **Observability**: Command-line execution with configurable logging

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Initial version with basic error models
2. Integration with GaiaSimu library
3. Support for cluster/grid deployment
4. Compliance with final MDB ICD
5. Enhanced noise model implementation
6. Pre-launch version with overlapping effects capability

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Evolving MDB specifications**: Maintain modular design for easy updates
- **Error model availability**: Implement gradual model integration approach
- **Performance requirements**: Optimize source-by-source processing
- **Platform dependencies**: Use Java for cross-platform compatibility
- **Data volume scaling**: Design for distributed processing environments
