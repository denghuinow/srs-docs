# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) is a ground data system for processing telemetry data from the ASPERA-3 instrument package aboard ESA's Mars Express mission. APAF acquires telemetry via NISN, processes it into IDFS data sets, distributes data to the science team, provides web displays, maintains local archives, and submits data to NASA's Planetary Data System. The system handles data from six ASPERA-3 components plus Mars Express orbit/attitude data. Non-goals include multi-state operations, safety requirements, and installation-dependent adaptations.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **ESOC**: Provides ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry data
- **APAF Operator**: Manages daily processing and system operations
- **ASPERA-3 Science Team**: Accesses processed data for analysis
- **Co-Investigators**: Receive distributed IDFS data sets
- **Public Users**: View web-based displays of current data
- **NASA PDS**: Receives archived data submissions

Main scenarios: Daily telemetry acquisition and processing, IDFS data distribution, web display generation, PDS archiving. Exception scenarios: Error handling during processing, password protection for sensitive data access.

## Business Process
**Main Process (Daily Data Processing):**
1. Trigger: Daily telemetry receipt from ESOC
2. Acquire ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry via NISN
3. Process telemetry into IDFS data sets
4. Generate intermediate cleaned-up telemetry files (if needed)
5. Store telemetry and IDFS data on local archive
6. Distribute IDFS data to Co-Investigators
7. Update web-based displays
8. Prepare data for PDS submission

**Key Branch (Error Handling):**
1. Detect processing error
2. Log error details
3. Generate error notification
4. Implement recovery procedure

**Key Branch (Data Distribution):**
1. Determine Co-I data needs
2. Select distribution mechanism
3. Apply password protection
4. Transmit data electronically

## Domain Model
- **Telemetry Data**: source (required), timestamp (required), packet_type (required)
- **IDFS Data Set**: virtual_instrument (required), processing_date (required), validation_status (required)
- **Web Display**: display_type (required), data_range (required), access_level (required)
- **Local Archive**: storage_location (required), data_type (required), retention_period (required)
- **Distribution List**: recipient (required), data_sets (required), delivery_method (required)
- **Processing Log**: process_id (required), status (required), timestamp (required)
- **PDS Submission**: dataset_id (unique), submission_date (required), compliance_status (required)
- **User Account**: username (unique), role (required), access_rights (required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **ESOC/NISN**: Inbound; ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry; Raw packet data; Data receipt confirmation; Daily transfer SLA
- **NASA PDS**: Outbound; IDFS data submission; Calibrated, validated data; Submission receipt; 6-month delivery requirement
- **ASPERA-3.org Web Server**: Bidirectional; Web displays and team access; User requests, display parameters; Processed data, graphics; 24-hour update cycle
- **Co-Investigator Distribution**: Outbound; Data delivery; Distribution lists, data selections; IDFS data sets; 24-hour delivery target
- **Local Archive System**: Bidirectional; Data storage/retrieval; Processing outputs, retrieval requests; Archived data, status; Continuous availability

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** daily telemetry is received from ESOC, **when** APAF processes the data, **then** IDFS data sets are generated and stored locally within 24 hours.

**Given** processed IDFS data is available, **when** distribution is triggered, **then** Co-Investigators receive data electronically within 24 hours of error-free processing.

**Given** science team defines display requirements, **when** data processing completes, **then** password-protected web displays are updated with specified data ranges.

**Given** validated ASPERA-3 data, **when** 6-month deadline approaches, **then** PDS-compliant data is submitted to NASA Planetary Data System.

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: Process daily telemetry within 24 hours; Update web displays within processing cycle
- **Reliability**: 99% uptime during mission operations; Automated error recovery for processing failures
- **Security**: Password protection for sensitive data; Restricted access to science team areas
- **Compliance**: PDS data format compliance; 6-month archival deadline adherence
- **Observability**: Comprehensive processing logs; System status monitoring capabilities

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Component SDD completion (Dec 2001 - Sep 2002)
2. System Design Document completion (Dec 2002)
3. Operations Procedures completion (May 2003)
4. Pre-launch system readiness (Jun 2003)
5. Operational data processing start (Post-launch)
6. First PDS submission (Within 6 months of data acquisition)

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
1. **Telemetry delivery delays**: Establish redundant communication paths with ESOC
2. **Processing errors**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
3. **Storage capacity issues**: Plan for scalable archive system with regular monitoring
4. **PDS compliance issues**: Early validation with PDS standards and formats
5. **Team access problems**: Multiple distribution mechanisms with fallback options
6. **Web display performance**: Optimize data retrieval and caching strategies
7. **Schedule slippage**: Phased delivery with contingency time buffers
8. **Resource constraints**: Regular resource assessment and allocation planning
