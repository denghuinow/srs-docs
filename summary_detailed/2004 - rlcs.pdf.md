# Detailed Summary

## Background and Scope
The I-15 Reversible Lane Control System (RLCS) Application Software will replace the current aging system to manage opening and closing of reversible lanes during peak traffic hours and special events. The software will interface with new controller devices and field hardware components through driver software interfaces. The system aims to support traffic management goals by safely controlling lane direction changes while providing status information to external systems. Non-goals include interfaces to unrelated applications and regulatory policy development.

## Role Matrix and Use Cases
- **Operator**: Controls system during normal mode; only one operator logged in at a time; authorized to change system mode
- **Management**: View reporting and status checking capabilities only
- **Field Maintenance Staff**: Control system during maintenance mode; execute maintenance sequences from field units
- **Electrical Systems Staff**: View reporting and status checking for hardware
- **Software Systems Staff**: View reporting and status checking for software
- **System Administrator**: Configure system data including staff, devices, and schedules; change system mode

Main scenarios: Opening/closing sequences, device status monitoring, alarm handling, scheduled operations
Exception scenarios: Device failures, communication outages, unauthorized access attempts

## Business Process
**Main Process - Lane Opening Sequence (8 steps)**:
1. Close barrier gates at opposite direction entrances
2. Open wrong-way pop-up devices
3. Open entrance longitudinal pop-ups
4. Open entrance transverse pop-ups
5. Open draw lights
6. Update changeable message signs
7. Verify all device statuses
8. Complete opening sequence

**Key Branch - Device Failure Handling (4 steps)**:
1. Detect device failure during sequence
2. Halt current operation
3. Notify operator with recovery options
4. Allow override or manual intervention

**Trigger**: Scheduled time or manual command
**Input**: System mode, device status, operator commands
**Output**: Device control commands, status updates, log entries

## Domain Model
- **Device** (ID, Name, Status, Location, Category, Last Maintenance Date - required)
- **Device Command** (ID, Device ID, Command String, Timeout, Command Level - required)
- **System Operational Command** (ID, Name, Description, Timeout, Command Level - required)
- **Personnel** (ID, Name, Password, Security Level - required/unique)
- **Alarm Type** (ID, Description - required)
- **System Mode** (ID, Name - required)
- **Location** (ID, Highway, Segment, Direction - required)
- **Device Status** (ID, Name, Description - required)

## Interfaces and Integrations
- **External Systems Interface**: Output to ATMS-2, ValuePricing/FasTrak, ATIS; Theme: Status data sharing; Input: RLCS status; Output: Facility status, customer eligibility; SLA: 30-second update frequency
- **Field Device Interface**: Bidirectional to controllers; Theme: Device monitoring/control; Input: Sensor data; Output: Control commands; SLA: 2-second response time
- **Remote Access Interface**: Bidirectional via firewall; Theme: Secure remote operation; Input: Login credentials; Output: System control; SLA: Secure encrypted connection
- **Database Management System**: Bidirectional to COTS DB; Theme: Data persistence; Input: Transaction data; Output: Query results; SLA: Sub-2-second response

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** the system is in closed state **When** scheduled opening time occurs **Then** the system shall execute opening sequence and update all device statuses
- **Given** a device failure occurs during operation **When** operator attempts override **Then** the system shall validate security level and allow continuation if authorized
- **Given** an operator is logged in **When** requesting system status **Then** the display shall update within 2 seconds with current device status

## Non-functional Metrics
- **Performance**: GUI updates within 2 seconds; device command response within 12 seconds
- **Reliability**: 99.99% uptime; 30-day continuous operation without reset
- **Security**: MD5 encryption for passwords; multi-layered command validation
- **Compliance**: IEEE standards for requirements specification
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging of all commands and system events

## Milestones and Release Strategy
1. Requirements finalization and approval
2. System architecture design completion
3. Development and unit testing
4. System integration testing
5. Field deployment and acceptance testing
6. Production cutover and legacy system decommissioning
Single release strategy encompassing all requirements

## Risk List and Mitigation Strategies
- **Wrong-way traffic risk**: Multi-layered safety screening and device status verification
- **Device failure during operations**: Override capabilities with security validation
- **Communication network failure**: Redundant control paths and degraded mode operation
- **Unauthorized access**: Multi-factor authentication and encrypted passwords
- **System integrity compromise**: Hash verification of non-volatile memory contents
- **Operator error**: Confirmation prompts and command validation rules
- **Hardware controller limitations**: Compatibility with modern controller specifications
- **Data corruption**: Regular integrity checks and backup procedures
