CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
1.1
Purpose
The purpose of this document is to present an overall description and listing of the func-
tionality of a Publications Management System (PMS). This document is intended for the
customer(s) and suppliers of the system including designers, testers and the implementation
unit.
1.2
Scope
The product will support the functionality of a PMS, which can be accessed by command
line and through a web browser (following the W3C XHTML-standards [3]). The PMS will
manage a database with bibliographical information and have the possibility to save the entire
text of a publication in pdf and postscript.
It will be able to automatically retrieve bibliographical information (like author, title,
etc.) out of the complete text of a publication and will provide the possibility to correct this
manually, if the obtained information is incorrect or insuﬃcient. The concept ‘author’ (name,
ﬁrst name, institute. . . ) will be explicitly known by the system and the user will be able
to manually indicate that references like ‘D. Vermeir’ and ‘Dirk Vermeir’ refer to the same
author. The possibility will also be provided to receive a ‘bulk update’.
The system will support several types of accessing, including accessing of the contents of
a publication, if the complete text (or only the abstract) is available and it will also support
access control.
1.3

Overview
The remaining part of this document is divided into two sections.
In section 2 we will describe the general factors that inﬂuence the product and its require-
ments. This section does not state speciﬁc requirements. Instead, it provides a background
for those requirements, which are deﬁned in detail in Section 3 of the SRS, and makes them
easier to understand.
Section 2 consists of six subsections, as follows:
• Product perspective
• Product functions
• User characteristics
• Constraints
• Assumptions and dependencies
• Apportioning of requirements


10
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
Section 3 will contain all of the software requirements to a level of detail suﬃcient to
enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test if the
system satisﬁes those requirements. Throughout this section, every stated requirement must
be externally perceivable by users, operators, or other external systems. These requirements
will include at a minimum a description of every input (stimulus) into the system, every
output (response) from the system, and all functions performed by the system in response to
an input or in support of an output.
Section 3 consists of six subsections, as follows:
• External interfaces
• Functions
• Performance requirements
• Logical database requirements
• Design constraints
• Software system attributes

CHAPTER 2. OVERALL DESCRIPTION
2.1
Product perspective
The PMS will rely on a database and a web server, which can be accessed by a web browser
and by command line.
There will be multiple types of users:
• A Guest is an anonymous user that is not connected to the VUB-network. Therefore
he/she will only be allowed to log in or register.
• A VUB-Network User is connected to the VUB-network, but is not logged in.
The
PMS will recognize them by their IP-address. They can access the database, search for
publications and download them.
• A Member is a user that has logged into the PMS and whose account only allows him
to search for publications and download them.
• A Publisher is a logged in user that can search for, upload and download publications.
• A Moderator has the same prerequisites and available functions as a Member, extended
with the authority to edit and delete publications.
• An Administrator has all the possibilities of a moderator extended with the responsibility
for the technical aspects of the PMS. He/She also has the possibility to up or downgrade
the accounts of users and in extreme cases he can even expel registered users.
Accessing the PMS from outside the VUB-network is only possible for logged in users.
Person(s) that are not logged in and/or connected to the VUB-network will only have Guest
privileges. To be able to log in a user will have to register an account. This requires that the
user provides their ﬁrst and last name, a password and a valid e-mail address. If a user is
accepted, he/she will receive a validation mail and by that way he/she will be able to conﬁrm
the registration of the user account.
Any user will be able to search for publications by title, author(s), institute,. . .
Also will
the user be able to specify that ‘D. Vermeir’ and ‘Dirk Vermeir’ refer to the same author and
that ‘VUB’ or ‘Vrije Universiteit Brussel’ refer to the same institute.


2.2. INTERFACES
13
2.2
Interfaces
2.2.1
System Interfaces
• Database: The system contains an interface with a MySQL-Database.
• Webserver: This Server is responsible for the execution of the PMS and the sending of
queries to the database. It’s also responsible for generating the user interface for each
user.
2.2.2
User Interfaces
• Users can access the PMS (taking into account their privileges) from any OS, using
a web browser that has a connection to the web server running the PMS. The PMS
should explicitly be accessible for users with Linux as OS and using a text based web
browser(eg. Links2 ). Administrator(s) can acces the system by command line from
within the VUB-network.
• There are no speciﬁc hardware requirements for the users.
• If an error would occur during a request, the user should receive an error message stating
what was the cause of the error. The error should also be logged in the PMS to notify
the Administrator(s) of the occurred technical diﬃculties.
• The PMS web interface will comply with the W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard
[3].
2.2.3
Communications Interfaces
Communication between the PMS(or more speciﬁcally the webserver) and the users will be
via a HTTP-connection using TCP/IP port 80.
2.2.4
Memory Constraints
There is no speciﬁc limit on the usage of memory by the PMS. The publications themselves
nevertheless will have a maximum ﬁle size, which for the moment remains TBD.
2.2.5
Operations
• A user has to be logged into (and registered to) the PMS or connected to the VUB-
network to be able to use (parts of) the functionality of the PMS.
• The other necessary/available operations (functionalities) are discussed in section 2.3
2.2.6
Site adaptation requirements
The PMS will be easy to install, with Ruby 1.8 (or later) installed and will run under a
Linux-based environment.


14
CHAPTER 2. OVERALL DESCRIPTION
2.3
Product functions
This subsection of the SRS provides a summary of the major functions that the PMS will
provide and for whome these functions will be available. These functions will be build up

available functions of the preceding one.
The hierarchical user structure will be as follows:
• Guest
• VUB-Network User
• Member
• Publisher
• Moderator
• Administrator
In this structure an Administrator has more functions than a Moderator, a Moderator
more than a Member,. . .

2.6. ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES
23
2.6
Assumptions and dependencies
• The users must have a web browser that supports W3C XHTML [3] and have a TCP/IP
connection to the web server.
• The http traﬃc must be possible on the network connection between server and client.
• Command line users have access to the server shell. Therefore they also have all the
Administrator privileges.
2.7
Apportioning of requirements
Following the demand of the customer(s) to have an early prototype available, the ﬁrst iter-
ation of the PMS will include the basic functions. Afterwards, in the second iteration, more
functions will be added to the PMS and the previous ones will be enhanced. For this purpose
the diﬀerent functions will be marked in section 3 as:
• Critical (C) (i.e. needed for the ﬁrst iteration)
• Suﬃcient (S) (i.e. needed for the second iteration to have an adequate end product)
• Optional (O) (i.e. implemented if there’s enough time left)

3.3
Performance Requirements
TBD
3.4
Logical Database Requirements
Logical database requirements All data will be saved in the database: static and dynamic
information, statistics, publications, administrator-settings, ... It’s very important to keep the
database consistent at all times: no pointers to deleted records, no redundant information,
etc The database must be capable to handle serveral requests at once, these requests happen
by using SQL-statements. A backup structure is also a requirement to save all the data in
case of server of disk problems.
3.5
Design Constraints
• The PMS web interface must be conform W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard [3].
• The implementation must be compliant with the Coding Conventions of SE1 [10].
• The implementation must be object-oriented.
• Design diagrams must be made following the UML standard [11].


3.6. SOFTWARE SYSTEM ATTRIBUTES
37
3.6
Software System Attributes
3.6.1
Reliability
• The PMS is developped so that it should not experience software faults. To be able
to achieve the least amount of software bugs we use a spiral model with 2 iterations.
For more information about the reliability of the PMS and the therefore used testing
processes see the SQAP [12] and STD [13] of SE1.
3.6.2
Availability
• The PMS will be available at all times from any computer ( fulﬁlling assumptions and
dependencies in Section 2.6 ), except when Wilma is not available. The availability of
Wilma is an issue that should be handled by the customer.
• In case of a corrupted database the Administrator should replace the database by the last
available database backup. In case of another failure (hardware or software related) the
problem should be ﬁrst solved and afterwards the PMS should be reinitialized. During
this downtime the PMS should give an error to the visitors , stating that the PMS is
temporarily down.
3.6.3
Security
• Every user account is protected with a personal password. Nobody except the speciﬁc
user should be able to log into that account and change personal information.
• The password of the user should be encrypted when submitted from user to server. It
should also be saved in an encrypted way in the database and no-one except the PMS
should be able to access these passwords.
• Direct access to the data stored in the database is only allowed for Administrator(s)
using the CLI.
• The user levels (see section 2.3) should always be respected with regard to editing,
deleting and uploading publications (and their bibliographical details) .
3.6.4
Maintainability
• The database of the PMS should be maintained by the Administrator(s).
• The PMS (with concern to the user levels, special privileges,. . . ) should be maintained
by the Administrators on a global level.
• On the Departmental level the Moderator(s) will be able to maintain the PMS this way.
If the PMS remains available under all circumstances, there are no other maintenance
measures to keep in regard.
3.6.5
Portability
The PMS is developped and tested to be able to run on Wilma, as speciﬁed by the customer.
Although this is a linux-based platform, it would be possible to relocate the PMS to
a server with a diﬀerent OS as long as all necessary software is available on it and some
adjustments are made. Because of the fact that this was not demanded by the customer, we
did not fully implement this feature in the PMS.
