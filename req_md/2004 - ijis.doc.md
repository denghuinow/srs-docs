   Introduction

The Integrated Justice Information System  (IJIS)  is  an  initiative  being
undertaken by Tarrant County, Texas. The vision for IJIS is  to  define  and
develop enhanced business  processes  and  supporting  technology  solutions
that result in a more effective and efficient administration of  justice  in
Tarrant County.  When  complete,  IJIS  will  facilitate  rapid  sharing  of
information across the  Criminal  Justice  Community  while  providing  each
stakeholder with advanced justice management capabilities.  The goal of  the
current phase of the initiative is  to  define  IJIS  business  requirements
shared by  the  Criminal  Justice  Community.  To  reach  agreement  on  the
business requirements, a three-stage approach will be been used:

   1. A baseline of use cases has been prepared to provide a starting  point
      for discussions with the  Criminal  Justice  Community.  The  baseline
      represents a compilation of requirements identified during  review  of
      background materials obtained from various sources.


   2. Workshops will be held  to  collect  requirements  from  the  Criminal
      Justice Community. The baseline requirements, documented here, will be
      reviewed, and requirements added, removed and refined.


   3. The material provided during the workshops will be consolidated into a
      single model, and reviewed at a final  workshop  with  representatives
      from the Criminal Justice Community.
