Data System Overview 
The ASPERA-3 instrument package (or ASPERA-3 experiment) will be flown on the Mars Express 
mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and will be launched in June 2003 according to the current 
schedule. ASPERA-3 contains a number of different sensors that will measure the particles, neutral 
atoms, and fields in the near Martian environment. Southwest Research Institute is providing the data 
system to produce data products in a form suitable for analysis and archiving. These data products will be 
put into a form known as the Instrument Data File Set (IDFS). 
The ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) is a ground data system responsible for 
processing all of the ASPERA-3 telemetry.  The APAF data system acquires the telemetry data via NISN, 
processes the data into IDFS data sets, distributes the IDFS data sets to the ASPERA-3 team, provides 
web-based displays of the most current data for public view, stores the telemetry and IDFS data sets on a 
local SwRI archive, and submits the ASPERA-3 IDFS data sets to PDS for long-term archival. 
The first step in defining the IDFS data sets is to identify the physical instruments that make up the 
ASPERA-3 experiment and any ancillary data necessary for scientific analysis.  There are six components 
of the ASPERA-3 package, plus the orbit and attitude data from the spacecraft: 
1. Data Processing Unit (DPU) 
2. Electron Spectrometer (ELS) 
3. Ion Mass Analyzer (IMA) 
4. Neutral Particle Detector (NPD) 
5. Neutral Particle Imager (NPI) 
6. Scanning Unit (SU) 
7. Orbit/Attitude (OA) 
Each of the physical components will be divided into logical groups (called virtual instruments) in which 
each logical group will be formatted as an IDFS data set.  Each of the seven components described above

will have an associated Software Design Document (SDD) that will define and fully describe all of the 
data products contained within each individual virtual instrument. 
 
1.3 
Goals and Objectives 
The APAF ground data system is to provide data processing algorithms and support to IRF for the 
ASPERA-3 science team (including Co-I’s) in preparation for the Mission Operations and Data Analysis 
(MO&DA) phase of the Mars Express mission.  In addition, validation and archiving of all ASPERA-3 
scientific data in the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) within 6 months of receipt in a form useable by 
the general scientific community is to be provided by the APAF. 
 
1.4 
Document Overview 
Section 2 is an overview of the descriptions of requirement determination, qualification procedures, 
rationale, and traceability that are used in the identification and the definitions of the requirements. The 
requirements of the APAF data system are categorized and defined in Section 3. Section 4 contains 
general information to aid in the understanding of this specification.

2.0 REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTIONS 
2.1 
Requirement Identification 
Each requirement shall be: 
• 
Necessary: It states a condition for the acceptance of the system.  
• 
Verifiable: It is stated in such a way that an objective test can be defined for it. 
• 
Attainable: It is technically feasible and can be accomplished within schedule and budget. 
• 
Clear: It is singular, concise, and simple.  
Each requirement shall be: 
• 
assigned a project-unique identifier. 
• 
annotated with associated qualification (verification) methods (see section 2.2). 
• 
annotated with rationale (see section 2.3). 
• 
annotated with associated traceability to their source (see section 2.4). 
2.2 
Qualification Provisions 
For each requirement in Section 3, the method(s) to be used to verify that the requirement has been met is 
annotated. Qualification methods included in this specification are: 
• 
Demonstration: observing function of the system without requiring instrumentation, special test 
equipment, or subsequent analysis. 
• 
Analysis: processing accumulated data obtained during characterization, calibration, or testing of 
the instrumentation. For example, simulated instrument data sets can be created from the 
accumulated calibration and test data by putting this data into the expected telemetry format that 
will be input into the APAF data system. These simulated data sets can then be processed into 
IDFS data sets and the Southwest Data Display and Analysis System (SDDAS) can be used to 
analyze the output from the APAF data system. 
2.3 
Rationale 
The rationale behind each requirement is documented, if applicable, in Section 3 along with each 
requirement. Rationale may include: 
• 
assumptions 
• 
why a requirement is needed 
• 
how a requirement is related to expected operations 
• 
design decisions made at higher system levels 
2.4 
Requirements Traceability 
The relationship between each requirement and the project item(s) that it addresses is documented along 
with each requirement identified in Section 3. A requirement may address any number of project items 
including a system-level requirement, a customer request document (e.g., an RFP), a proposal, or other 
documentation. A requirement may also address a higher-level design element. For proper traceability, 
the following information is provided for each requirement: 
• 
Requirement Identifier 
• 
Requirement Description 
• 
Requirement Source (e.g. RFP, proposal, SRS, etc): Source of the requirement 
•

Other Requirements Considered 
This section identifies the requirements considered but not part of the APAF ground data system 
requirements. 
3.9.1 Required States and Modes 
The APAF data system is not required to operate in more than one state or mode. 
3.9.2 Adaptation Requirements 
There are no installation-dependent requirements for the operation of the APAF data system.  However, if 
any are identified, they shall be documented in the APAF Operations Procedures Document. 
3.9.3 Safety Requirements 
The APAF data system will not impose hazards to personnel, property, or the environment.  Therefore, 
there are no safety requirements of the APAF ground data system. 
3.9.4 Software Quality Factors 
Although the APAF data system and associated software will be developed with the highest quality 
possible, there are no requirements concerned with software quality. Some of the software quality factors 
that will be considered when developing the APAF data system include: reliability, maintainability, 
availability, flexibility, portability, testability, and usability. 
3.9.5 Design and Implementation Requirements 
There are no requirements that constrain the design and implementation of the APAF software. 
3.9.6 Personnel-Related Requirements 
There are no identified requirements related to personnel that will use the software. However, the APAF 
Operations Procedures Document will aid personnel in the operational use of the APAF system. 
3.9.7 Training-Related Requirements 
Since the members of the SwRI software team are experienced with data system and IDFS processing 
software development, there are no training-related requirements for developers of the APAF data system. 
In addition, the APAF Operations Procedures Document shall provide installation and operations

4.0 NOTES 
To aid in the understanding of this specification, the requirements imposed on SwRI for the development 
and operation of the ASPERA-3 Mission of Opportunity (MO) of the NASA Discovery Program as they 
are relevant to the APAF ground data system are documented here. These are taken directly from the 
Program-Level Requirements for the ASPERA-3 Mission of Opportunity Project which is an appendix to 
the NASA Discovery Program Plan. 
In Section 4.1.1, Baseline Science Requirements, it states: 
“…the ASPERA-3 MO shall provide the complete data set of the integrated ASPERA-3 
investigation to all ASPERA-3 Co-I’s and the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS). The specific 
measurements delivered shall be as follows: 
4.1.1.1 Measure integral ENA fluxes in the energy range of 0.1 to 60 keV. 
4.1.1.2 Measure mass/energy resolved neutral hydrogen and oxygen atom spectra in the energy 
range of 0.1 to 100 keV. 
4.1.1.3 Measure ion energy/mass/angle resolved spectra in the energy range of 0.001 to 40 keV; 
1-1e6 atomic mass units per unit charge (amu/q); with 4pi steradian coverage. 
4.1.1.4 Measure the electron spectra in the energy range of 0.001 to 20 keV, with 4pi steradian 
coverage. 
4.1.1.5 Measure ions and electrons in the energy range of 0.001 to 40 keV; 1-1e6 amu/q.” 
 
In Section 4.3, Launch Requirements, it states: 
“…data processing software shall meet the delivery requirements of the IRF in order to support 
the launch date and operation of the ESA Mars Express mission.” 
 
In Section 4.4, Ground System Requirements, it states: 
“SwRI shall develop the ASPERA-3 data reduction system and software to be used during 
instrument integration, test, calibration and mission operations for the full ASPERA-3 
experiment. This task will include interfacing with all ASPERA-3 sensor teams to determine and 
effect data packetization and storage strategies. This system shall be available on a schedule to 
satisfy the mission needs per agreement with IRF, and to satisfy the data availability requirements 
established in Section 4.5.1. 
SwRI shall provide processing algorithms to IRF in preparation for the mission operations and 
data analysis phase of Mars Express on a schedule to satisfy the mission needs per agreement 
with IRF.” 
 
In Section 4.5.1, Science Data Management, it states: 
“…the ASPERA-3 MO PI shall be responsible for collecting engineering and ancillary 
information necessary to validate and calibrate the scientific data prior to depositing it in the 
NASA PDS in a PDS-compliant form. The time required to complete this process shall be the 
minimum necessary to provide accurate scientific data to the science community and the general 
public, but it shall not exceed six months after acquisition.”

In Section 4.5.2, Analysis Software, it states: 
“Science analysis software developed by the ASPERA-3 MO PI team for this project shall be 
integrated into the NASA approved data repository. The PI team and the science community shall 
have equal on-line access to this software.” 
 
In Section 4.5.3, Data Management Plan, it states: 
“The ASPERA-3 MO Project shall develop a project data management plan to address the total 
activity associated with the flow of science data, including planning, acquisition, processing, data 
product generation and validation, archiving, and preservation. The plan shall identify science 
and supplementary data products, systems associated with handling the data, and the roles, 
responsibilities, and operational interfaces affecting those data and systems.” 
Note: This Program-Level requirement has been met with the generation and delivery of the 
APAF Project Data Management Plan (PDMP).
