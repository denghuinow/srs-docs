Introduction
Background
WARC Tools Phase I and Phase II
The main goal of the WARC Tools project is to facilitate and promote the adoption of the WARC ﬁle format 
for storing web archives by the mainstream web development community by providing an open source 
software library, a set of command line tools, web server plug-ins and technical documentation for 
manipulation and management of web archive ﬁles, or WARC ﬁles.
This project has delivered a core software library called “libwarc” and a set of end user command line 
tools, extensions to existing tools, and simple web applications for accessing WARC content. In addition 
all the libraries have APIs and dynamic language bindings. The library and tools are scriptable (command 
lines in shell scripts, dynamic language bindings to the library), and programmable (dynamic language 
bindings, Java packages, and the C library itself). 
Together, these deliverables are known as “WARC Tools” and are available as free software, here: http://
code.google.com/p/warc-tools/ 
In parallel, Hanzo have developed an extension to WARC Tools that provides full-text and metadata search 
of WARC ﬁles, known as “Search Tools”, which is also available as free software, here:  http://
code.google.com/p/search-tools/ 
Together, these projects provide a compelling implementation of the WARC standard, and provide a robust 
engineering foundation for further development of tools and applications centred around WARC ﬁles and 
their usage.
WARC Tools Phase III
Following the development of libwarc and associated WARC Tools in phases I and II, Hanzo will implement 
a third development phase, WARC Tools Phase III. This phase will build upon the original libwarc, 
extending the collection of WARC Tools and implement a full migration application. Phase III will include 
community participation in the speciﬁcation of the tools and applications, these will come from a number 
of International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) member institutions, and similarly for testing. 
Phase III implementation will follow the original philosophy of providing powerful tools to enable crawl 
engineers, web archivists, researchers and other WARC users to easily manipulate and explore collections 
of web archive content without needing to write complex low-level code. 
Outline Approach
WARC Tools Phase III will specify, build, test and deploy the following:
1.
Migration Application
2.
Repackaging Tool
3.
Reporting Application

In addition, Hanzo will carry out the following tasks as part of the project:
1.
Collaborative requirements gathering and requirements management
2.
Libwarc maintenance
3.
Project management and meetings
4.
Deployment within participating institutions
The project will be organised around a collaborative engagement with the web archiving community, 
inviting IIPC member institutions to collaborate and contribute functional requirements and deployment 
and testing of the tools and applications in their own institutions. 
Speciﬁcally, Hanzo plan to involve IIPC member institutions to work on creating and/or reviewing 
requirements during the inception phase of the project, which includes a questionnaire prepared by BnF. 
During the transition phase, when working towards project closure, IIPC member institutions are invited to 
collaborate on acceptance testing of the tools within their “real world” settings; involving deployment of 
the tools and applications within participating institutions. 
Participating institutions are:
Denmark (Netarchive.dk) — will contribute at the testing level, will use a copy of some of their data 
as test data. Happy with the speciﬁcation to date, but wish to be kept informed of changes and 
developments.
Norway (NL) — will contribute through testing and collaborating, based on their own plans to 
convert their web-archive to WARC (approximately 2,000,000,000 URLs).
UK (BL) — will contribute both at the requirement speciﬁcation and testing stages of the project, 
possibly using their selective archive as test data.
France (BnF) — will contribute at speciﬁcation stage and at testing stage also. Will provide ARC 
ﬁles as test data. Will facilitate circulation and sharing of all useful information between this 
project and other ongoing relevant work on WARC usage run by the IIPC Preservation WG and the 
IIPC Technical Committee.
Sweden (NL) — form of contribution to be conﬁrmed.
New Zealand — will contribute in the speciﬁcation and the migration process.
This approach will ensure the community will have ﬁrst-hand use and knowledge of the tools in their real-
life environment, serving as further acceptance and veriﬁcation of the toolset as a whole.
This Functional Requirements Speciﬁcations (FRS) is a base-line statement of functional requirements for 
the project as a whole, including high-level estimates of effort and schedule, based on the above 
approach and assumptions and best-practice estimation. Following review of the FRS and questionnaire 
additional estimation and scoping exercises will be carried out to ensure the project remains within the 
base-line scope. Any institutional requirements that cause the project to exceed this scope will be ﬂagged 
and the institution may either de-scope the requirement or provide additional ﬁnancial contributions to the 
project, thereby keeping the requirement in scope.
Also listed in this document are Non-Functional Requirements (NFR), which are requireents reﬂecting 
higher level goals.
WARC Tools Phase III Functional Requirements Speciﬁcation 
2


Speciﬁcation
Default Behaviours
The following features of WARC Tools commands are to be provided by default. All other modules of WARC 
Tools, such as migration tool, repackaging, reporting, etc., will inherit these capabilities.
NFR 1 — The tools shall be able to process a set of multiple WARC ﬁles at the same time. For this 
purpose, the tools will allow you to choose/group them by:
• explicit naming
• wildcard name matching
• size limitation
• number of items
NFR 2 — The tools shall be able to scale to process large collections using distributed processing and 
data transport (see FRS 10 and 11)
NFR 3 — The tools shall offer best possible performance to correctly process large collections (I/O 
bound)
NFR 4 — The tools shall be able to run on multiple machines but will not provide functionality for 
dealing with hardware failures (out of scope)
NFR 5 — Implementation of the tools shall avoid unnecessary technology dependencies and shall not 
include development of partner-speciﬁc integration technologies
NFR 6 — The tools shall be compliant with Java development environments, by using web services, 
RESTful API’s, etc. 
NFR 7 — The tools shall provide logging facilities, for example, to follow command progression, i.e. 
process duration, output levels, etc.
NFR 8 — The tools shall provide enhanced usability by providing easy to adapt shell script wrappers for 
the major commands
NFR 9 — It shall be possible to operate the tools in modes that restrict their effects to selected collection 
subsets. For example, select by name (see NFR1), random sampling, etc. 
Migration Application
The migration application provides workﬂow to support and manage the arc → warc migration process 
and veriﬁcation functionality to check and validate by content and metadata (time, URL, etc.). 
NFR 10 — The workﬂow system shall have a conﬁgurable management strategy for migration from ARCs 
to WARCs.
Additionally, the migration application would provide checks and balances throughout the migration 
process to ensure it is veriﬁable and working properly. This application will be designed to support large-
scale migration to WARC,  in which we expect to migrate millions of ARC ﬁles to WARC. It will be important 
to take real-life requirements from IIPC member institutions into account. 
The migration application will consist of four components:
1.
A workﬂow/conﬁguration application to set up the migration conﬁguration. A web user interface shall 
be available to set up the migration. End point is a migration conﬁguration that can be used in a 
migration job. Conﬁguration shall persist as a conﬁguration ﬁle or database.
2.
Migration tool to migrate content from a collection of ARC ﬁles to WARC ﬁles
WARC Tools Phase III Functional Requirements Speciﬁcation 
3


3.
Validation command-line tool to validate content in a collection of WARC ﬁles against the original 
ARC ﬁles content. 
4.
A console to report on progress of active migration processes (such as the Heritrix console), manage 
the process, view logs, etc.
Non-functional requirements concerning scale of migration will need to be developed alongside the 
functional requirements. It should be noted that libwarc and WARC Tools in general have been 
implemented to deal with very large scale operations by ensuring all functionality is performed with 
minimal memory usage and performed atomically by simple tools in the style of UNIX.
NFR 11 — The migration workﬂow system will be driven by command line tools and scripts
NFR 11.1 -- Migration conﬁgurations can be built with a Web User Interface
NFR 11.2 -- Active migrations can be monitored, paused, and restarted (a console application) with a Web 
User Interface
NFR 12 — Pre and post conversion actions will be provided for at each level of the migration, e.g. record, 
WARC, job
The migration and validation tools are described below.
Migration Tool
A tool will be created to migrate content from a collection of ARC ﬁles to a collection of WARC ﬁles.
$ arc_warc_migrate <ARC_FILES> <CONFIG> [options]
The command arc_warc_migrate uses a list of ARC ﬁles and will migrate them based on the conﬁguration 
ﬁle CONFIG. Each ﬁeld should describe how it will be translated into WARC records. If some ﬁelds are 
missing, errors will be generated that require operator intervention. 
FR 1 —  The migration workﬂow shall provide a clear Application Programming Interface  (API) to handle 
the migration process and default conﬁguration.
FR 2 —  The migration API will require inclusion of only one header ﬁle.
FR 3 —  A conﬁguration must be provided explicitly, errors should be generated in the absence of a 
conﬁguration.
FR 4 —  The user shall be able to provide metadata related to the conversion that will be stored in the 
converted ﬁles (e.g., institution, context, crawler, collection name, ...)
FR 5 —  It shall be possible to request that automatically generated migration metadata be stored in the 
converted ﬁles (e.g., OS/Kernel type,  original ARC name,  ARC size, ARC digests, conversion timestamp, 
ARC record offset, ...)
NFR 13 —  IIPC members should provide us with the default METADATA they want to be included for 
migration.
Example conﬁguration ﬁle directives:
• undeﬁned_mime: by default, “unknown_mime” will be applied when no MIME type is found
• ignore_bad_record: if any error occurs during the conversion, skip the record and log the problem. 
• segment_ﬁlter_record: the ARC record will be split into multiple WARC Continuation records each one 
not longer than N bytes. The last record  maybe less than N bytes; note that no record will end in such 
a way as to split a multi-byte character.
• metadata_record: a user-supplied metadata record that will be added one to each WARC ﬁle.
WARC Tools Phase III Functional Requirements Speciﬁcation

FR 6 — The migration workﬂow shall be able to call external tools and services (e.g., database queries, 
shell commands, web service).
The migration tool will permit use of external tools or services to generate preservation and migration 
metadata to be stored in the WARC records. As such the arc2warc command will become one out of 
several processes to be used for migration. 
Examples of external tools and services are:
• tools to create persistent identiﬁers for WARC-record-ID
• ﬁle identiﬁcation services (DROID, FILE, JHOVE) to ascertain the format of a ﬁle and write it as WARC-
identiﬁed-payload. 
• tools to scan ﬁles for malware and viruses and identify them as such in the WARC ﬁle
FR 7 — The migration process shall use persistent, opaque, unique, and global identiﬁers for records 
access.
For example:
• Noid:    http://search.cpan.org/~jak/Noid-0.424
• ARK:    http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/ark
• UUID:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identiﬁer
FR 8 — A (default) external tool (e.g., ClamAV) will be used to scan ﬁles before conversion (pre-conversion 
step).
FR 9 — The API should be ﬂexible enough to allow external tools such as JHOVE, DROID to be used for 
ﬁle format identiﬁcation.
Such external tools or services will be identiﬁed in the strategy conﬁguration ﬁle. The manager should be 
able to follow the progress of a migration process (eg.,number of migrated records/ﬁles, time spent and 
time remaining, etc.), whether it is running on one machine or is distributed across machines.
FR 10 — The  ARC to WARC migration should be able to run on multiple machines that will be easy to 
deploy. This may be achieved by using a simple messaging infrastructure.
FR 11 —Logging during the migration may be turned on/off at any time .
FR 12 —  Software checkpoints (such as start-trans, end-trans) may be added during processing for 
managing atomic transactions (e.g., operations on a ﬁle, these must start and complete to be accepted in 
the migration), except where operating system limitations would prohibit it. 
Note that it should be possible to avoid having to specify any network code or learn a foreign API, which 
accounts for considerable complexity, for example, in map-reduce solutions (e.g., Hadoop, Google Map/
Reduce). The process migration will take care of these issues at runtime. To start more clients in parallel, 
this code would be called multiple times from either the local machine or any machine on the local 
network, causing more clients to begin processing the server data concurrently. This will form the parallel 
arc2warc conversion strategy used in WARC Tools Phase III.
FR 13 — It shall be possible to perform a “dry-run migration”. That is, a blank conversion to generate 
useful reports (performance issues, bad ARCs, time estimation ...) without writing real WARC data (i.e. 
simulating only). Dry run is deﬁned entirely by the conﬁguration.
WARC Tools Phase III Functional Requirements Speciﬁcation 
5


While doing a migration, we shall be able to detect and avoid duplicate documents. For this purpose, we 
will implement checksum-based deduplication. Other deduplication mechanisms can be implemented with 
pre- record actions. 
NFR 14 — Deduplication may be run before migration, inside a batch process.  
FR 14 — Duplicate detection shall ﬁnd and report WARC records with the same checksums. A centralised 
database will be used to store previously processed records, against which new ones will be compared.
Post migration database can be used for reporting on migrations job-by-job.
Validation Tool
A tool will be created to validate content from a collection of WARC ﬁles. 
$ arc_warc_verify <ARCFILE> <WARCFILE> <USER_DEFINED_ARC_READER> [options] 
This command validates whether a migration carried out with arc_warc_migrate was successful or not. 
The validation process looks at each record contained in the ARC ﬁles, extracts the corresponding content 
from the WARC ﬁles and compares them by computing a checksums. It will also be possible to compare a 
user-deﬁned set of metadata values.
FR 15 — To validate that the migration succeeded, arc_warc_verify will use the METADATA included in the 
newly generated WARC ﬁles to match records with their corresponding ARC ﬁles (see FR4, and FR5).
An option will be provided to let the tool sample a random percentage of records rather than perform an 
exhaustive check. This is provided mainly for rapid veriﬁcation of large collections, advisable when 
conﬁdence in the process is high.
FR 15.1 — Core validation shall use payload checksum comparisons.
FR 16 — Sampling will be provided where applicable to quickly validate the conversions (FR 15.1 and FR 
18 for example).
For this purpose, arc_warc_verify will be aware of record MIME-Types and will sample record types in 
proportion to their representation. 
By default, the process will use WARC Tools ARC reader and WARC reader/writer. As an alternative it can 
use an external ARC reader (for example arcreader from Heritrix) or even a wrapper on a non-ARC based 
extractor.
FR 17 — Validation shall use Heritrix’s arcreader to double check that the original ARC record was 
correctly converted to WARC.
FR 18 —  It shall be possible to perform a round trip validation: migrate the newly created WARC ﬁle back 
to ARC and compare both checksums (NFR 5)
Repackaging Tool
A tool will be created to extract WARC records from a collection and generate a new set of WARC ﬁles. 
This is useful for testing, QA, initial crawl planning and transferring selected material to third parties.
$ warc_repackage -i <WARC_FILE> <WARC_PATTERN> [options]
WARC Repackage takes as input a set of WARC ﬁles, extracts the content according to the supplied 
options, and writes the content to new WARC ﬁles.
FR 19 — It shall be possible to repackage WARC ﬁles by ﬁltering records based on URL (regular 
expressions)
FR 20 — It shall be possible to repackage WARC ﬁles by ﬁltering records based on MIME-Types.
WARC Tools Phase III Functional Requirements Speciﬁcation 
6


FR 21 — It shall be possible to repackage WARC ﬁles by ﬁltering records based on size. 
FR 22 — It shall be possible to repackage WARC ﬁles by ﬁltering records based on timestamp (e.g., dates 
interval).
FR 23 — It shall be possible to repackage WARC ﬁles by ﬁltering on any ﬁeld in the WARC speciﬁcation.
FR 24 -- Repackaging will allow pre and post record, ﬁle and job operations
FR 24.1 -- Pre operation can prevent a ﬁle or record being processed by returning  value
Options will specify a number of ﬁlters, based on URL, timestamp, WARC metadata, etc., using both 
simple and advanced regex mode (similar to ‘‘grep  -e’’).
The identiﬁed records are written into new WARC ﬁles, with output names based on the WARC_PATTERN 
speciﬁed. Options may be speciﬁed for output WARC ﬁle size, etc.
FR 25 — Each repackaged WARC ﬁle shall include a user-deﬁned METADATA record which will describe the 
extraction context (e.g., ﬁlter used, involved WARC ﬁles, ... - see also FR4). 
Additional metadata records will be added to show the output WARCs as repackaged.
Reporting Application
The reporting application consists of two components:
1.
WARC Summary Tool to report on the content of a collection of WARC ﬁles
2.
WARC Browser Integration to provide a web user interface for the reports
WARC Summary Tool
A tool will be created to report on the content of a collection of WARC ﬁles. The basic report form is 
similar to the form produced by the crawlers; this can be useful when a crawler report is not otherwise 
available for a collection. 
FR 26 — The migration framework shall provide tools to build reports from WARC ﬁles 
The summary tool also enables ﬁne grained manipulation of the reports and the production of useful 
variations.
warc_summary WARC_FILES [options]
WARC_FILES can be a list of WARC ﬁles (including wildcards, etc.) or a directory WARC ﬁles.
Example reporting outputs:
1.
(default) summary - similar to a crawl-report, shows the number of documents, start / end date for 
contents, etc, with options to detect and report multiple crawls (if the WARC ﬁles are from multiple 
crawls), similar to ‘‘lscrawl’’.
2.
mimetypes - a mimetype report, with options to show a breakdown by host, domain , crawl, etc.
3.
hostnames - a host report, with options to show a breakdown by crawl , number of documents, etc.
4.
status codes - a frequency table of status codes, with options to show breakdown by host, domain, 
crawl, etc.
5.
pseudo crawl log - a list of time-ordered URLs and status information from the WARC ﬁle, with 
options to show a breakdown by crawl, host, domain, etc.
NFR 16 — Repackaging ﬁlters can be used by the summary module
FR 27 — It shall be possible to export summaries in various formats (e.g., XML, CSV) 
WARC Tools Phase III Functional Requirements Speciﬁcation 
7


This command will also have options for XML and CSV output and ﬁltering, for example, to restrict the 
report by time ranges, domain or other metadata values.
WARC Browser Integration
The proposed work will include the integration of ‘’warc_summary’’ and ‘‘warc_browser’’ (from phase II), 
which will display a directory full of WARC ﬁles. Integration will enhance the front page to show links to 
view and explore the above reports including graphs.
FR 28 — Enhance the WARC browser to display aggregated WARCs summaries in its UI
FR 29 — Enhance the WARC browser to display a manifest of WARC ﬁles and their locations 
Quality Assurance Tool
WARC Comparator
A tool will be created to make a comparison of similar crawls, based on analysis of their WARC ﬁles.
$ warc_compare <CRAWL_1_WARC_FILES> ... <CRAWL_N_WARC_FILES> [options]
where WARC_FILES can be a list of WARC ﬁles (including wildcards, etc.) or a directory of WARC ﬁles. 
Options have a variety of functions:
• ﬁlters to limit by URL patterns, timestamp, metadata records, etc.,
• to show reports broken down by domain, hostname, etc., and
• to add a graph generator for the purpose of WARC quality assurance (Q.A).
FR 30 — Provide a ‘‘diff‘‘ tool to compare WARC sets based on deﬁned criteria (e.g., timestamp, 
hostname, etc.)
FR 31 — Provide a tool to draw difference graphs between WARC collections (see FR 30)
A WARC ’’set comparator’’ enables comparison of crawl results contained in two sets of WARC ﬁles. It will 
be possible to identify important differences (deltas) between multiple/repeated crawls of the same seed. 
This will be very useful for QA of repetitive crawls.
FR 32 — Provide a way to view crawls deltas for quality assurance
For example, consider a monthly crawl of “www.foo.org”. A WARC Set Comparator would provide a delta 
report showing the following information:
• Percentage change in what is provided in the summary
• A listing of changed pages, with links to the major deviations
Enhanced WARC Browser
Small enhancements to the WARC Browser will be implemented to ensure that it provides a good quality 
browsing experience. Typical enhancements will include a proxy mode and server-side rewriting using a 
rules-based approach.
FR 33 — Implement WARC browser server side rewriting
FR 34 — Integrate a proxy mode inside the WARC browser
Another enhancement is to ensure the Search Tools project is updated and integrated; this will produce 
full text indexes and provide full-text search functionality to the WARC Browser and on the command line.
FR 35 —  Integrate the full-text search (search-tools project) module with the WARC browser to provide 
users with WARC indexing/searching capabilities.
