Introduction


1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to fully describe the external  behavior  of
the SCM system in terms of functional requirements. It  also  describes  the
nonfunctional  requirements  such  as  usability,  availability,   security,
maintainability and  reliability.  In  addition,  it  specifies  the  design
constraints and standards that are needed to be applied on SCM.


2 Scope

This document represents specification of the SCM  system  requirements.  It
serves  as  the  baseline  document  on  which   the   subsequent   software
development life cycle phases are built.

that they have the high school level or higher and they can read  and  write
in English with basic knowledge of using computer programs.


2.4 Constraints

      The system has many constraints. For example, the system must be  web-
based and all tools must be compliant with .Net technologies, i.e., We  must
use ASP.NET and C# as programming language and MS SQL as DBMS. We  are  also
constrained with Ejada's framework and the system will later  be  integrated
with other  two  modules  in  the  framework.  Ejada  has  some  programming
standards that we must commit to.

2.5 Assumptions & Dependencies

      We assume that the  server  machine  of  the  system  has  a  suitable
Microsoft OS. This machine has a connection to internet.

2.6 Apportioning of Requirements


      Our SCM system requires including all requirements prior to the  first
delivery.

3.1.4 Communication Interfaces

The SCM system will use TCP/IP as the main communication protocol trough
internet/network.

Also, it might communicate with external systems in the future, such as
customer relation management system and HR systems. The scope of our system
does not require to interact with other interfaces but it can be
customized.

3.3 Performance Requirements
      The system must  handle  at  least  100  concurrent  users  and  their
operations. The system must accomplish 90% for transactions in less  than  1
second. This is due to the nature of data, which is  only  text  information
that does not usually exceed 50 KB per transaction.



3.4 Logical Database Requirements
The DB tables shall reflect following:
   -  Coordinator
    - Customer
    - Supplier
    - Resource Location
    - Item
    - Request


3.5 Design Constraints

3.5.1 Programming language:
Our System will be web based system which  we  will  use  a  web  developing
language. We will use ASP.NET  and  C#  languages.  The  system  has  to  be
designed on .NET Framework 3.5 using Visual Studio family.


3.5.2 Database:

The system will use MS SQL for our database.


3.5.3 Software Process:

The system shall follow the  Waterfall  software  process  model.  Also  the
system shall be designed in an  Object  Oriented  approach  so  that  future
features can be easily integrated with the system.




3.5.4 Ejada framework:

The system has to use the Ejada .Net frame work and also our system will
integrate with two modules in Ejada.

3.6 Software System Attributes

3.6.1 Reliability
      All data will be backed-up everyday automatically and also the  system
administrator can back-up the data as  a  function  for  him.  Also  if  any
errors, fault or failures happen the system will  detected  and  inform  the
user about problems and also if there is any transaction with  the  database
and in that time happen no action to the data and the system  will  back  to
the previous state of database. Also  our  system  will  cover  the  quality
assurance.


3.6.2 Availability
      The system has to be available 100% of the time. Once there is a fatal
error, the system should give understandable feedback to the user.


3.6.3 Security

      The system have only three roles for coordinators , suppliers and
customers only that make our system secure access online and these
authentications will prevent and illegal access.

3.6.4 Maintainability


      The system is designed in modules where errors can be detected and
fixed easily. This makes it easier to install updates and new functionality
if required.


3.6.5 Portability

      The system can operate in any of the latest Microsoft operating
systems with the latest .Net framework. Due to the web based nature of the
system, the host machine must also have Microsoft IIS installed



4. Change Management Process

Every change in the SRS will be done by the developing team and it is
updated in the SRS review report which contains all the information of the
change shush as change date, author, the change is applied on what , and
why the changed is applied.
