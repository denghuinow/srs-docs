1. Introduction 
1.1 Purpose and Perspective 
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes the functional and nonfunctional 
requirements for the System Administration Module of an Integrated Library System (ILS). The 
requirements were developed specifically for King County Library System, but are believed to be 
suitable for many large, urban, multiple-branch, centralized library systems.  
 
 
The requirements in this SRS presuppose the general data structures and functionality of a full-
fledged ILS. The System Administration Module will replace and enhance the current capabilities of 
commercially available ILSes, as well as add new functionality. 
1.2 Product Scope and Features 
The System Administration Module facilitates the management of every aspect of the Integrated 
Library System. Specifically, the System Administration Module support the following activities, 
among others: 
 
 
•
Configuring the ILS to enable and support features and processes required for management 
of the Library branches, patrons, collections, and circulation transactions. 
•
Monitoring, troubleshooting, and controlling server performance. 
•
Monitoring, troubleshooting, and controlling database and application performance. 
•
Monitoring, troubleshooting, and controlling services, ports, and application programming 
interfaces. 
•
Managing user and group accounts and privileges. 
•
Managing server and client software installation, upgrades, and updates. 
•
Backing up databases, configuration files, log files, etc. 
The current specification presupposes the general functionality of an ILS and specifies only those 
requirements that directly or indirectly relate to management activities. King County Library has 
previously published specifications for Acquisitions and Serials Management, Circulation, and 
Cataloging modules. Requirements for OPAC and web services are currently under development. 
Moreover, the current specification is focused on functional characteristics of System 
Administration. Data structures and user interfaces will require further specification and 
development using an iterative, prototype-oriented software development methodology. 
1.3 Intended Audience 
This SRS is intended both for library managers and staff who may contribute additional 
requirements or commentary, and for software project managers and developers who will implement 
the requirements. As such, it aims for a high level of readability for a non-technical audience, while 
providing enough specificity to be useful to a software developer.  
It is assumed that when software development occurs, it will be in a highly collaborative and 
iterative environment in which end-users have multiple opportunities to review prototypes and 
refine the user interface and software functionality. 


Software Requirements Specification, System Administration of an Integrated Library System 
Page 2 
It is also assumed that the reader has a general understanding of Library services and processes and 
does not require definition of common Library terminology. 
1.4 Document Conventions 
The SRS includes requirements. Requirements include a reference to a process flowchart where 
appropriate. Flowcharts generally indicate the current approach to System Administration at King 
County Library System, and should be considered to give contextual information rather than to 
prescribe or constrain new software development. 
1.5 User Classes and Characteristics 
Patron 
A Patron is a customer of King County Library System, either possessing a 
library card or not, either on site of a community library or not, using either print 
materials, media materials, or electronic resources. 
Staff 
Staff include managers, librarians, library technicians, library assistants, and 
library pages who are involved in designing and providing services for the 
Library. 
 
 
System 
Administrators 
System Administrators include staff with responsibility for managing servers, 
databases, applications, services, ports, and APIs related to the ILS. 
Managers 
Managers include management staff who oversee Library processes. 
Library 
Managers 
Library Managers include Cluster and Site Managers who provide input to the 
design and implementation of Library services. 
Library 
Directors 
Library Directors include members of the Library Executive Team who plan and 
direct Library services and priorities. 
1.6 Operating Environment 
OE-1: 
System Administration support the needs of a large, multiple-branch library system. 
Specifically, the system must support a library system with 50 locations, 20 million 
circulations, purchasing and processing over 500,000 items per year.  It is highly 
desirable that searches and reports can be processed during open hours without 
disrupting other system functions. 
OE-2: 
System Administration shall operate on a Linux or Solaris server. 
OE-3: 
System Administration shall be accessible through a web-browser or a Windows-
compatible client. 
OE-4: 
If web-browser based, System Administration shall be accessible through Microsoft 
Internet Explorer (v.6.0 and later) and Mozilla Firefox (v.2.0 and later). 
OE-5: 
System Administration shall be accessible with screen-reading software, screen-
magnification software, and other software programs designed to increase 
accessibility. 
 
 
1.7 Design and Implementation Constraints 
CO-1: 
System Administration Module shall use a fully relational database back-end. 


Software Requirements Specification, System Administration of an Integrated Library System 
Page 3 
CO-2: 
System Administration Module shall produce standards-compliant HTML. 
CO-3: 
System Administration Module shall provide a development and training 
environment with the ability to migrate configurations to a production environment. 
CO-4: 
User rights and privileges will be controlled through security groups and/or “roles” 
that allow access control for individuals, workgroups, and arbitrary staff groups. 
1.8 User Documentation 
UD-1: 
The software developer shall provide complete data specifications for authority 
records, bibliographic records, order records, item records, hold/request records, and 
other records maintained or accessed by the System Administration Module. 
UD-2: 
The software developer shall provide a thorough high-level description of major 
processes, including bibliographic record import and export, validation of 
bibliographic records against internal and external authority sources, and standard 
reports. 
UD-3: 
The system shall provide an online, hierarchical, and cross-linked help system in 
HTML that describes and illustrates all system functions. 
1.9 Assumptions and Dependencies 
AS-1: 
The System Administration Module is part of an enterprise-level Library Automation 
System. 
AS-2: 
System Administration process are consolidated at a central location, and accept 
input and provide services to multiple locations. 
DE-1: 
The System Administration Module relies on the data structures and functionality of 
an enterprise-level Library Automation System, including Acquisitions and 
Cataloging modules. 
DE-2: 
The System Administration Module interface with a variety of vendor websites, via 
published APIs and/or automated transfer of standard-format data files (e.g. 
USMARC21, EDIFACT). 
DE-3: 
The System Administration Module interacts with a patron interface, also known as 
an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC.
