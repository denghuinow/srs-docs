Software Requirements Specification  
1. 
Introduction 
This section introduces the System Requirements Specification (SRS) for Project 
ZNIX to its readers. 
1.1 Purpose 
The purpose of this software requirements specification (SRS) is to establish the 
major requirements of the Project ZNIX research and development effort. 
Project ZNIX is an attempt to refine traditional information management 
systems to provide an object-based, application-independent retrieval and 
manipulation framework. 
1.2 Scope 
The SRS applies to the higher level design of the ZNIX Framework. 
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations 
This section provides the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations 
required to properly interpret the SRS. Note that capitalization styles are used 
throughout the document to distinguish ZNIX-specific terms. 
1.3.1 ZNIX 
ZNIX is not an acronym. The term was decided upon to suggest the aspirant 
notion that a fully ZNIX integrated operating system could be the last (thus the 
letter “Z”) major evolution for POSIX system. 
1.3.2 ZNIX Framework 
The ZNIX Framework is a collection of system services (daemons) that: 
• 
Facilitate user interactions with information and, 
• 
Expose lower level functionality through a public API

  Version:           1.0 
Software Requirements Specification 
Document ID: ZNIX-SRS 1.0 
  Date:  April 30, 2005 
 
Often, the terms Project ZNIX and the ZNIX Framework and Framework Shell 
would be used interchangeably at this stage. 
1.3.3 Client Process 
A client process is a software application that interacts with the ZNIX 
Framework by either utilizing the public API or by directly accessing the 
information presented by the Framework. Note that all client application need 
not be “ZNIX-aware” (i.e. knows that the information it accesses are managed 
by the Framework). As long as its operation involves an intervention by the 
Framework at some point, an application may be considered a ZNIX Client. 
1.3.4 ZNIX Proxy Mechanism 
The Proxy Mechanism is the collection of Framework components that enable 
“ZNIX-unaware” applications to utilize the Framework capabilities. 
1.3.5 Entity 
An Entity is the basic block that builds up ZNIX’s information hierarchy. 
Entities are first class citizens of the ZNIX Framework; which simply means 
that the Identity of an Entity is unique and non-dependant on any other Entity.  
1.3.6 Associate 
An Associate is similar to an Entity, differing in the fact that its Identity is 
dependant on at least one Entity. The Framework’s interest in an Associate 
depends solely on its relationship(s) to first class citizens. As such, when the 
last related Entity breaks the relationship to an Associated (i.e. loses interest in 
it), it will be removed from the ZNIX data1 store as it no longer has any 
significance in the context. 
                                          
1 Note the use of the word “data” when it has been stated that the word “information” is preferred in this context. The thinking behind 
this is that, what the framework manages is raw data; it will associate a meaning to this data effectively transforming them into 
information.

2. 
Overall Description 
Project ZNIX envisions a world which leaves behind a one that users manage 
information by mastering software applications [Zachary, 1994]. Emphasis in 
this approach is on information2 and its semantics. It seeks to make meaningful 
information accessible to users in ways they themselves declare to be logical. 
2.1 Project Perspective 
Project ZNIX SHOULD distinguish itself form other information management 
systems by its superior integration with the operating system. The Framework, 
in its operation, SHOULD resemble the schematic diagram displayed in Figure 
1.3.6-A. 
 
Figure 1.3.6-A 
                                          
2 In ZNIX terminology the word “Information” is always preferred over the word “data”, as the former implies that there is an 
associated “meaning”.

2.1.1 Benefits over alternatives 
2.1.1.1 Project Haystack 
“Haystack is a tool designed to let every individual manage all of their 
information in the way that makes the most sense to them” [WWW01]. 
Sharing the idea of a centralized store for all types of information with ZNIX, 
Project Haystack provides a tool (an extendable browser) for accessing the 
managed information. This tool is however, a standalone application with little 
support for 3rd party applications. Although, it does provide means for 
developers build additional, unless the project is adopted as a global standard 
there would be little incentive for the development of (especially commercial) 
extensions. 
ZNIX includes both an API and a proxy mechanism. The API would enable 
developers to build applications that utilize the full potential of the Framework. 
The proxy mechanism would enable many established 3rd party applications to 
interact with the Framework. 
Requirements to run Haystack on an Intel PC include 512 megabytes of RAM 
(with 768 megabytes strongly being recommended). ZNIX Framework SHOULD 
run comfortably on systems with only 256 megabytes of RAM.  
2.1.1.2 Windows Longhorn 
Project ZNIX was largely inspired by an ancestor of Microsoft’s Windows 
Longhorn. However, since at the time of this specification, features inherent in 
this operating system have not been finalized, little conscious effort will be 
taken to incorporate them into ZNIX.  
It has been reported that “by the time Longhorn ships, according to Microsoft 
chairman Bill Gates, PCs will have 4GHz to 6GHz processors, more than 2GB of 
memory, at least a terabyte of storage, and graphics accelerators three times 
more powerful than those offered by ATI and NVIDIA today” [WWW02]. ZNIX on 
the other hand is designed from the ground up to run on system with far less 
resources.

2.2 Product Functions 
• 
Provide a centralized archive for user’s information.  
• 
Provide hierarchical model for managing the archived information. 
Hierarchies maybe inheritance based, association based or based on any 
other type of relationship conceived by the user. 
• 
Allow the user to add, remove, modify or back up (to removable storage 
devices) arbitrary pieces of information without disrupting the hierarchy. 
• 
Assist the user in building up his information hierarchy by automating 
such tasks as data capturing and categorizing. 
• 
Provide a simple API for developing ZNIX-aware client applications. 
2.3 User Characteristics 
The browser GUI SHOULD be designed such that even casual users could easily 
manipulate their information with little or no training. It is expected that the 
bulk of the ZNIX user-base would be home users, managerial staff, executives, 
and researchers who are likely to possess only basic IT skills.  
2.4 Constraints 
The system design MUST be subjected to the following constraints: 
• 
Hardware: Intel Pentium III or compatible 1-GHz PC with 256 megabytes of 
RAM 
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies 
The system design MAY assume that all interfaces designed for the 3rd party 
software listed in Table 3.9.3-A will be compatible with their subsequent 
releases. Thus, for instance, when the system is found to be compatible to 
Windows 2000 Professional Service Pack 4, it MAY be assumed to be Windows 
2000 Professional Compliant, regardless whether other service releases would 
break the system.

The applications listed in this table are assumed to be safe from vulnerabilities. 
The security offered by these products will form the basis of the security of the 
Framework. 
It is assumed that supporting the software listed would be sufficient to serve 
the intended user-base, considering their popularity on Microsoft Windows 
based systems.

3. 
Specific Requirements  
3.1 Functionality 
This section describes the functional requirements of the system. 
3.1.1 Centralized store for user information 
The Framework MUST be capable of capturing information form the software 
tools specified in Table 3.9.3-A. The data captured SHOULD be stored in a 
centralized data store. The Framework MAY decide whether the information 
should be stored as Entities or Associates.  
The data capturing and archiving mechanisms MAY resemble the following. 
3.1.1.1 Type of Information: Personnel 
Mechanism: 
i. 
The Address Book is used to create Entities under the category “People” 
(Category names are user definable. However, a certain set of categories 
like People, Email etc. MAY need to always be present). 
ii. 
User SHOULD be able to modify, add, delete or group these Entities by 
navigating to a virtual folder (e.g. /People/). 
3.1.1.2 Type of Information: Email (Outbound) 
Mechanism: 
i. 
The email is intercepted before it is dispatched to the SMTP server.  
ii. 
An Associate is created to contain the message body. 
iii. 
The recipient name(s) are used to create (if required) Entities under the 
“People” category. The Associate is then linked to each Entity. 
3.1.1.3 Type of Information: Email (Inbound) 
Mechanism:

  Version:           1.0 
Software Requirements Specification 
Document ID: ZNIX-SRS 1.0 
  Date:  April 30, 2005 
 
i. 
The email is fetched from the POP3 server. 
ii. 
An Associate is created to contain the message body. 
iii. 
The sender’s name is used to create Entities, under the category 
“People”. The Associate is then linked to this Entity. 
3.1.1.4 Type of Information: WWW Documents 
Mechanism: 
i. 
User SHOULD be able to specify when he is to start a research project; i.e. 
when the web sites he visits subsequently are to be permanently stored. 
ii. 
The project name specified by the user spawns a new Entity in the 
Framework. 
iii. 
An associate is created as an archive and is linked to this Entity. 
3.1.1.5 Type of Information: Textual Documents 
Mechanism 
i. 
The user after editing a document in a word-processor invokes a special 
GUI supplied by the Framework. 
ii. 
The GUI allows him to draw arrows to and from (a symbol representing) 
the current document to any Entity creating relationships between the 
document and the relevant Entities. 
iii. 
The user may optionally specify a descriptive name for the document. 
iv. 
The document is automatically saved to disk in a manner that reflects 
the relationships it has to other Entities. The user may in the future 
fetch this document by following the relationship paths that he had 
created.  
The GUI described in section 3.1.1.5 MAY also be made available when dealing 
with other types of information as well.

Software Requirements Specification 
Document ID: ZNIX-SRS 1.0 
  Date:  April 30, 2005 
 
3.1.2 Hierarchical view of the information 
The user MUST be able to view the information in the central store in a 
hierarchical manner that makes sense to him. Section 3.1.1 describes how this 
hierarchy is built up. The Framework SHOULD include a browser that is 
capable of displaying this hierarchy in a UI similar to that of the Windows 
Explorer. The browser MAY OPTIONALLY be integrated directly in to Windows 
Explorer, rather than being a standalone application. 
This browser MAY integrate the GUI described in section 3.1.1.5 as well. 
3.1.3 Archiving of information 
Often, the user may want to archive portions of the information-store to 
removable storage media (the term storage media covers only CD-ROMs and 
USB Pen Drives at this point). However, this SHOULD not mean that such 
portions would be “forgotten” by the Framework. 
Therefore, some residue MUST be left on the data store to indicate that a 
portion of data has been archived. For example, assume all information relating 
to a “Person” Entity named John is archived to a CD-ROM. When the user 
subsequently looks for John, the Framework SHOULD NOT declare that such 
an Entity was not found. Rather, it SHOULD inform the user that the Entity 
has been archived (and OPTIONALLY, if he wishes to proceed, to remount the 
relevant storage device). 
3.1.4 The public API 
The Framework API should expose at least the following functionality to client 
processes. 
• 
Create, delete and modify Entities and Entity groups 
• 
Create, delete and modify relationships between Entities 
• 
List and access Entities with an API similar to that of a standard file 
system API. 
• 
Execute queries for the retrieval of Entities using different criteria.

  Date:  April 30, 2005 
 
The API that exposes Entity listings MAY be designed to be similar to the 
System.IO APIs of the .NET Platform which provide directory and file listings. 
3.2 
Usability  
3.2.1 Typical training time required 
GUIs associated with the Framework SHOULD be designed such that an user 
with basic understanding of the Windows 2000/XP operating systems would 
instinctively be able to interact with them. Therefore, most GUIs MAY need to 
closely mimic popular Windows applications. 
3.3 Reliability  
This subsection specifies the following requirements associated with the 
reliability of the system. 
3.3.1 Mean Time between Failure (MTBF) 
The mean time between failures (MTBF) SHALL exceed 3 months. 
3.4 Performance 
3.4.1 Capacity 
At this stage of the development, the Framework MAY only operate in single 
user mode, with no networking capabilities. 
3.4.2 Resource Utilization 
The Framework Shell SHOULD NOT utilize more than 40 megabytes of RAM.

3.5 Supportability 
3.5.1 Coding Conventions 
Any coding conventions to be used during implementation MUST be 
documented before the beginning of the phase, and strictly adhered to during 
the phase. 
3.5.2 Compliance to Opens Source Standard Practices 
Project ZNIX SHOULD be available to its potential users in source and binary 
from, and free of charge. The project MAY be hosted on a popular Open Source 
distribution website such that the Open Source community is aware of (and 
contribute to) its existence. 
The website for distributing the project SHALL include provisions for the users 
to make comments on the product as well as to compile a wish-list of features. 
3.6 Security 
The Framework MUST guard against malicious scripts on remote websites from 
accessing its information. 
The Framework MUST guard against unintended corruption of information by 
the user himself. 
3.7 Design Constraints 
No design constraint has been imposed at this stage. 
3.8 Online User Documentation and Help System Requirements 
The online help system should be compiled utilizing as much of non-technical 
terms as possible. Care SHOULD be taken not to produce an exhaustive user 
documentation as that would defeat the main purpose of the system as 
expressed in the introduction to section 2. 
A comprehensive Developer’s Guide MAY be compiled to facilitate 3rd party 
ZNIX-aware applications.
