Introduction 
 
1.1 
Purpose  
This document describes the requirements for the Triangulation Games software.  
 
1.2 
Document Conventions 
All the references in this document have been made by using running 
numeration. When you see a number between closures, example [1] this means 
that it refers to the first reference mentioned in the reference section at the end of 
this document.  
 
There is a glossary at the end of the document, where the more uncommon 
terms are explained.  
 
1.3 
Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions 
The document is meant for the software project group and also for the client to 
specify what will be implemented in the Triangulation Games software.  
 
1.4 
Project Scope 
Triangulation Games software is an application that makes it possible to play 
various different combinatorial games as solitaire, against the computer’s AI or 
with another player. The system also functions as a platform for defining new 
types of triangulation games.  
 
2 
Overall Description 
 
2.1 
Product Perspective 
Triangular Games is a stand-alone software application that is meant to realize 
games described in the article “Games on Triangulations” [1].  
 
2.2 
Product Features 
The software makes it possible to play multiple triangulation games (see [1], for 
more information on triangular games). The games may be played alone or 
against another person, depending on the type of game. A graphical user 
interface will be shown to the user. This user interface is mainly mouse controlled 
but may also be used with a keyboard as well.   
 
By default, the system will be able to implement three different games, namely 
constructing, transforming and marking. New games may be added to the 
software easily without the need to modify the code of the original application. 
These added games will be automatically selectable through the application’s 
graphical user interface.  
 
 


2.3 
User Classes and Characteristics 
The main user class is player. This is the most important user class and the user 
interface design will be geared towards serving the player. The software is 
however designed mostly for research oriented people coming from areas such 
as mathematics, social sciences and computer sciences.  
 
Although all research people have an academic background, the technical level 
of experience may vary greatly. This means that no assumptions about highly 
experienced users can be made. The user interface will be designed to serve the 
needs of inexperienced players. 
 
Since adding new games to the software will also be possible, one user class is 
the game developer. People from this user class will have experience in playing 
the games and the scientific background behind creating new games. This user 
class is not as important as the player class and users of this class are mostly 
interested in the ease of defining new games.   
 
2.4 
Operating Environment 
The software will be implemented using the Java-platform. This makes it possible 
to run the application on multiple different environments without any modification 
to the code. The software requires a mouse or a keyboard, a graphical user 
environment (X window system, Windows, Mac, etc.), and Java-runtime 
environment (version 1.4 or later)[2].  
 
2.5 
Design and Implementation Constraints 
The client has requested the use of the Java environment, so the platform has 
been chosen before design. Because of the cross-platform requirement, the 
software cannot be dependent on platform-specific libraries. 
 The software should run well on any computer which has Java 2 (version 1.4 or 
later) Runtime Environment (JRE)[3] installed. Installation should be easy, so no 
external databases should be required.  
 
2.6 
User Documentation 
Documentation about how to define new games will be provided to make it 
possible for non-developers to create new games for the system. There are 
going to be two end user documentations: 
 
- 
User manual, for end users. It will describe how to use the system for 
playing. 
- 
Maintenance manual, for end users and new developers. It will describe 
how to specify new games for the system. It will also contain the design 
documents and interfaces of the system, as well as the source code. If 
necessary, it will describe also how to implement a plug-in (such as an AI) 
for the system. 
 
 


2.7 
Assumptions and Dependencies 
This software will be released under the GPL-license.

Safety Requirements 
The system does not use or receive network connections and is used locally. 
This means that no network safety requirements exist. Overwriting an existing file 
on the file system has to be confirmed from the user to prevent accidental loss of 
data.  
 
5.3 
Security Requirements 
No personal information is stored by the system so no specific security 
requirements need to be defined.  
 
5.4 
Software Quality Attributes 
The system is playable with the minimum setup defined earlier in Hardware 
Requirements.  
 
SQA-1: The system shall run well on both Linux and Windows and should be 
playable with the mouse or the keyboard or both. 
 
6 
Traceability 
Most of the requirements in this document are based on the initial interviews with 


Timo Poranen (the client) and brainstorming meetings of project group. The 
article [1] provided specific and exact requirements that are directly related to the 
nature of triangular games.  
 
7 
State of the Requirements 
 
7.1 
Stable Requirements 
All the requirements having medium or high priority are stable requirements and 
will not undergo any change. 
 
7.2 
Volatile requirements 
The requirements with low priority might go under change as the system takes 
shape and implementing them might prove to be a waste of time and resources.

Appendix A: Glossary 
 
 
AI 
Acronym of “artificial intelligence”. In this 
context an Artificial Intelligence is a software 
entity that is able to calculate and decide 
movements for an instance of a game while it is 
being played, thus making it able to play games 
on its own. 
Developer 
A person involved in the code generation of the 
system. There are both those belonging to the 
actual project group, and those who want to 
improve the system once it has been published 
under GPL license. 
Ending Condition 
A condition described in the rules of a game 
that defines when a game ends. 
End User 
People who will execute and use the system. 
There are both those who are going to play, or 
those who are going to develop new games, 
starting positions and/or artificial intelligences. 
Game 
A triangulation game defined in the article [1] 
GPL 
General Public License. See [3] 
Graph 
See [1]  
 
Opening position 
The starting position of a game. Coordinates 
for the point which defines the graph. Details in 
[1].  
Player 
In the game context, the entity that makes a 
movement in a turn. While playing, a person or 
an artificial intelligence machine can both play 
the role of a player. Since a player can be also 
an AI, it’s necessary not to confuse a ‘player’ 
(concept) with an ‘end user’ (people). 
Random Opening Position 
An opening position made by the system with 
random starting parameters. 
System 
The triangular game application that this 
document describes.  
 
 


Appendix B: Requirements List 
 
Functional Requirements  
 
AI 
The system has an artificial intelligence that 
the player may play against. The artificial 
intelligence supports every two player game 
Game.AutomaticSearch 
The system searches an external source for 
games on startup and loads them. 
Game.Continue 
The system has an embedded AI that takes 
over from a player when asked to do so. 
Game.Defined 
The system supports defining new games 
without modifying the source code.  
Game.End 
All the games end on a pre-defined condition 
Game.Help 
The system has an embedded help file that 
contains basic solutions and hints for 
problematic situations 
Game.Load 
The system loads the game from a file 
Game.Multiple 
The system supports multiple games, and 
can load them from an external source. 
Game.MultipleOpeningPositi
ons 
The system has support for multiple opening 
positions that can be applied to all the 
games.  
Game.Save 
The system saves the game in a file 
Game.SaveOpeningPosition
s 
The system saves all the defined opening 
positions so that they are available after a 
restart.  
Game.Solitaire 
The system has support for solitaire games 
Game.TwoPlayerSupport 
The system shall support two player turn-
based gaming.  
GUI 
The system uses a graphical user interface to 
display data to the user 


GUI.keyboardInput 
The system can be used fully with a keyboard 
GUI.mouseInput 
The system can be used fully with a mouse 
 
 
Non-Functional Requirements 
 
UI-1 
 
All the user interfaces will be designed following 
common usability guidelines. A specific user interface 
document will describe the user interface more 
accurately. 
UI-2 
The user interface uses one main window for the actual 
game playing and possibly dialog windows for changing 
the general settings of the system.  
HI-1 
The system functions on a computer that has a screen 
for output and keyboard or mouse or both for input.  
SI-1 
The system requires a working Java-environment [2] 
and a graphical user interface supported by the Java 
Swing-library.  
PR-1 
The games should be playable on a 450 MHz or higher 
class computer. 
PR-2 
The artificial intelligence must operate fast enough. The 
next move should be calculated within 10 seconds. 
SQA-1 
The system shall run well on both Linux and Windows 
and should be playable with the mouse or the keyboard 
or both.
