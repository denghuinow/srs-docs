Balise 
 
 
A passive or active device normally mounted in proximity to the track for 
communications with passing trains. A standard for passive balises has been 
devised within the EUROBALISE project. 
Broadcast call 
 
A call made to all members of a pre-defined group within a local geographical 
area. Only the initiator of the call may talk with all other group members 
listening only. 
Cab radio 
 
 
The radio and associated user and other interfaces installed in the cab of a 
locomotive and for use principally by the locomotive driver. Definition also 
includes those radios supporting ATC. 
Call type 
 
A prefix used to identify the User Number dialled. 
Chief conductor 
 
A member of the train crew with overall responsibility for passenger related 
Railway activities on-board the train. 
Coach number 
 
A number assigned to an item of rolling stock on a permanent basis. The coach 
number may form a component of a functional number used to address 
users/systems on an item of rolling stock. 
Controller 
 
 
An individual responsible for the conduct of some aspect of train operations 
(also known as dispatcher). For the purposes of this specification the following 
functional roles of controllers are defined: 
− primary controller; 
− secondary controller; 
− traffic controller; 
− power supply controller. 
 
Dependent upon local circumstances, a number of functional roles can be carried 
out by a single controller or a single functional role can be carried out by a 
number of controllers.

GSM standard, which complies with all related mandatory requirements as 
specified in the EIRENE FRS and SRS. An EIRENE system may also include 
optional features and these shall then be implemented as specified in the 
EIRENE FRS and SRS. The EIRENE System includes terminals. 
Engine number 
 
A number assigned to an item of traction stock on a permanent basis. The engine 
number may form a component of a functional number used to address 
users/systems on an item of traction stock. 
Fiche 
 
A UIC fiche or leaflet is a document adopted by UIC members. Statements 
within the fiche may comprise specifications which are binding on UIC members 
(‘obligatory’ specifications) or optional (‘recommended’ specifications). The 
existing track-to-train radio standard is contained within UIC fiche 751-3. It is 
envisaged that the EIRENE standard will be covered by a new UIC fiche, 751-4.

List of definitions 
Functional addressing/numbering 
 
A term used to describe the process of addressing a call using a number 
representing the function a user is performing, rather than a number identifying 
the user’s terminal equipment. 
Functional identity 
 
The full alphanumeric description of the function performed by a called or 
calling party within the functional numbering scheme, identifying them by 
function or role rather than by a specific item of radio equipment or user 
subscription. The functional identity can include characters and/or numbers. 
Functional number 
 
The full number used within the functional addressing scheme to contact an end 
user/system by function or role rather than by a specific item of radio equipment 
or user subscription. 
General purpose radio 
 
A standard GSM radio based closely on commercially available units for general 
use. 
Group call 
 
A call made to all members of a pre-defined group within a local geographical 
area. Only one member of the group may talk at any instant with all other group 
members listening only. 
Handover 
 
The process by which connection between the GSM mobile and the GSM 
network is maintained as the mobile moves from area to area, by passing 
communication channel control from one base station to another or between 
different channels in one cell. 
High speed line 
 
A section of route forming part of the European High Speed Rail Network and 
any additional routes specified as such by national administrations. 
Link assurance signal 
 
A form of unidirectional signalling transmitted periodically or constantly from 
one radio to another to allow the receiving user to detect a break in radio 
transmission during critical manoeuvres (eg during shunting).

PSA167D006-15
 
 
Location dependent addressing 
 
A term used to describe the process of addressing a particular function (typically 
a controller) based on the current location of the user (typically a train). 
Multi-party call 
 
A voice communication method whereby a number of parties defined by the call 
initiator may participate in the call. All parties may talk simultaneously.  
Multiple driver communications 
 
A term used to describe communications between the drivers of each active cab 
in a train comprising multiple traction vehicles. 
Operational communications 
 
These are railway communications directly concerned with train movements or 
train operation. For example controller-driver communications. 
Operational radio 
 
A handheld radio suitable for use by people involved in railway operations (eg 
shunting team members). 
Power supply controller 
 
A controller responsible for the management of the traction power supply. 
Primary controller  
 
The location and direction of movement of any particular train permits the 
unique identification of a Primary Controller. The Primary Controller is 
currently the co-ordinator of train emergency calls. The Primary Controller is 
normally responsible for the operation of a designated area of track. The exact 
responsibilities of the Primary Controller are determined on a national basis. 
Radio Block Centre 
 
An ERTMS/ETCS term referring to a centralised safety unit to establish and 
control train separation using radio as the train to ground communication 
medium.

List of definitions 
Railway Access Code 
 
A prefix used to identify an EIRENE network outside the network the calling 
party is operating in. 
Railway emergency call 
 
A high priority call for informing drivers, controllers and other concerned 
personnel of a level of danger requiring all Railway movements in a pre-defined 
area to stop. Two types of Railway emergency calls are defined: 
− 
Train emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst not involved in Shunting 
operations). 
− 
Shunting emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst involved in Shunting 
operations). 
Roaming 
 
 
The use of a mobile on any communications network other than the user’s home 
network.  
Routing database 
 
The database that contains the registered relationships between the functional 
number and the MSISDN. 
Secondary controller 
 
A Secondary Controller is a train controller who holds responsibility for the safe 
running of trains on a designated area of track (e.g. a signaller). Secondary 
Controllers require the facility to communicate with trains in all situations in 
order to perform their function. The split of responsibilities between Primary 
Controllers and Secondary Controllers is determined on a national basis. 
Shunting emergency call 
 
A Railway emergency call used to instruct shunting teams to cease shunting 
movements immediately. 
Shunting team 
 
A group of people manoeuvring trains in order to change their composition. 
Communications for shunting are particularly critical when a driver at the front 
of a train is pushing it backwards towards buffers or other potential obstructions. 
In this case a lookout is often required to report progress to the driver.

PSA167D006-15
 
 
Stock number 
 
A number assigned to an item of traction or rolling stock on a permanent basis. 
A stock number may form a component of a functional number used to address 
users/systems on an item of traction or rolling stock. 
Support communications 
 
These are railway communications which are not directly concerned with train 
movements or train operation. For example such communications might involve 
the passage of catering, maintenance or timetable information. 
Traffic controller 
 
A controller who has responsibility for the scheduling of trains and the ‘flow’ of 
trains over the network. For example, traffic control personnel are responsible for 
such activities as holding connecting services and minimising disruption to the 
timetable. The traffic control function has no formal safety responsibility. 
Train control system (TCS)

by the driver. For the purposes of this specification, reference to the train control 
system also encompasses automatic train protection, automatic train operation 
and in-cab signalling. 
Train controller 
 
A controller who has responsibility for the safe movement of trains. 
Train number 
 
A number given to a train by operational staff for a particular journey. A train 
number may form a component of functional number used to address 
users/systems on a train. 
Tromboning   
 
Tromboning may occur when a call is placed to a roaming mobile in the same 
country as the call originator. Tromboning is the term given to the routing of a 
call via the mobile’s home country and back. This is obviously undesirable. 
User number 
 
The entry in a routing database. It consists of two parts: the User Identifier 
Number and the Functional Code.

The application of this specification will ensure interoperability for trains and staff 
crossing national or other borders between systems. It also intends to provide 
manufacturing economies of scale wherever practical. (I) 
1.3 
Applicability  
1.3.1 
The EIRENE System Requirements Specification defines the set of requirements which 
a railway radio system shall comply with in order to ensure interoperability between 
national railways. (I) 


PSA167D006-15 
 
 
Page

Introduction 
1.3.2 
The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification [EIRENE FRS] specifies the 
functional requirements for EIRENE. (I) 
1.3.3 
The specification distinguishes between requirements affecting a railway’s network 
infrastructure, onto which mobiles will roam, and the requirements concerning 
mobiles which may be used in any EIRENE compliant network. (I) 
1.3.4 
The statements made in the specification are assigned to one of three categories: (I) 
− 
Mandatory (indicated by ‘(M)’ at the end of the paragraph). It is mandatory that 
each railway meets these specifications where interoperability on lines, or 
equipment interoperability, is required. 
− 
Optional (indicated by ‘(O)’ at the end of the paragraph). Whilst not being 
mandatory for interoperability, when the option is selected, the method defined in 
the SRS and FRS by which such features are implemented becomes mandatory, 
both to provide a consistent service and to present a recognised and agreed 
standard to manufacturers in order to obtain economies of scale in development 
and manufacture. 
− 
Information (indicated by ‘(I)’ at the end of the paragraph). These are statements 
intended to provide explanatory notes. 
1.4 
System overview 
1.4.1

The scope of the specification is shown in figure 1-2, showing the hierarchy of the 
GSM, and railway features to be implemented. (I) 
 
 
 
Figure 1-2: Scope of the GSM-R system with reference to functionality provided by GSM 
1.4.1.3 
A list of ETSI and 3GPP specifications is provided in the normative references 
section of this document. (I) 
1.4.1.4 
Compliance to the list of normative documents is mandatory for all of the GSM 
services necessary to provide the functionality specified in the [EIRENE FRS]. (M) 
1.4.1.5 
Later releases of these specifications may be used, providing that the system is 
backwards-compatible with the versions listed. (I) 
1.4.2 
Outline architecture 
1.4.2.1 
The system is based on the GSM architecture which is summarised in figure 1-3. (I)

Introduction 
 
Figure 1-3: GSM architecture overview 
1.4.2.2 
The system comprises the following elements: (I) 
− 
Base station sub-systems (BSSs) of base station controllers (BSCs) controlling base 
transceiver stations (BTSs) each containing a number of transceivers (TRXs). 
− 
Network sub-systems (NSSs) interfacing to the BSS via the GSM ‘A’ interface. The 
NSS contains mobile services switching centres (MSCs) with primary responsibility 
for call control. The MSC is supported by a visitor location register (VLR) 
containing temporary details of subscribers active within the MSC area, a group 
call register (GCR) containing attributes of voice group and broadcast call 
configurations for the related MSC area and home location registers (HLRs) 
holding subscriber details on a permanent basis. 
− 
The network also comprises General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) infrastructure 
elements supporting the respective packet radio services. The serving GPRS 
support node (SGSN) is a location register function storing subscription 
information and location information for each subscriber registered in that node. It 
interfaces to the BSS via the Gb interface and to the MSC/VLR via the Gs interface 
and to the HLR via the Gr interface. The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is a 
location register function storing subscription information and routeing 
information (needed to tunnel packet data traffic destined for a GPRS MS to the 
SGSN where the MS is registered) for each subscriber for which the GGSN has at 
least one PDP context active. It interfaces to the SGSN via the Gn interface, to the 
HLR via the Gx interface, to external packet data networks via the Gi interface and 
to other GSM/GPRS networks via the Gp interface. 
− 
Mobile equipment (ME) interfacing to the BSS via the air (Um) interface. 
− 
Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) containing information specific to single 
subscribers. A standardised interface links mobile equipment to SIM cards. A SIM 
and ME combined are termed a mobile station (MS). 
− Operation and Maintenance Centre (OMC) for managing the network.

− 
Billing Centre. 
1.4.2.3 
Signalling within the NSS and between NSSs is carried out according to signalling 
system number 7, SS7, making specific use of the mobile application part (MAP) of that 
standard. (I) 
1.4.2.4 
Railway networks may implement a short message service centre to be interfaced to 
the GSM network in order to support railway specific messaging applications. (I) 
1.4.2.5 
A railway GSM network is also likely to have external interfaces to: (I) 
− 
private railway fixed networks; 
− 
public operator networks; 
− 
controller equipment; 
− 
specialised railway systems (eg train control systems). 
1.4.2.6 
EIRENE will provide the radio bearer for ERTMS/ETCS. The EURORADIO layers are 
responsible for ensuring the overall safety of the transmission link between train-borne 
and trackside ERTMS/ETCS applications. (I) 
1.4.2.7 
In addition to a GSM capability, a direct mode capability may be provided for railway 
mobiles for set-to-set operation. (I) 
1.4.2.8 
Standardised interface protocols are to be provided to allow applications external to 
EIRENE to access EIRENE bearer services. (I) 
1.4.2.9 
Applications may include: (I) 
− 
public address; 
− 
intercom; 
− 
driver safety device; 
− 
train borne recorder. 
1.4.3 
Railway specific services and facilities 
1.4.3.1 
To meet the specific railway requirements, a number of additional features are 
required some of which have been incorporated in the GSM Standard. The main 
aspects are summarised in the following paragraphs. (I) 
1.4.3.2 
Frequency: Equipment is to be capable of operation in the following frequency bands: 
(I)

Introduction 
Band 
Frequencies (MHz) 
Railway GSM (R-GSM) 
876-915/921-960 
Note: the R-GSM band includes the Public GSM (P-GSM) and Extended GSM (E-GSM) 
bands. 
1.4.3.3 
Voice broadcast and group call facilities: All mobiles are to support these services as 
defined in the relevant GSM specifications. The services will mainly be used to: (I) 
− 
broadcast messages from controllers to certain groups of trains in a controller area; 
− 
broadcast messages from trains or shunting team members to controllers or other 
mobiles in a defined area; 
− 
conduct group calls between train drivers and controllers over pre-defined areas; 
− 
conduct group calls between trackside workers, shunting team members, station 
staff and similar groups, typically over local areas. 
1.4.3.4 
Enhanced multi-level precedence and pre-emption: This GSM specification is to be 
implemented in order to achieve the high performance requirements necessary for 
emergency group calls. It is also necessary to meet different grades of service 
requirements for different types of communications traffic on the system (eg safety (eg 
train control system), operational and administrative communications). (I) 
1.4.3.5 
Functional numbering: Many railway staff need to be addressed by functional rather 
than personal numbers. The functional numbers may change on a regular basis. The 
principal example is that of train drivers, who need to be addressed by train numbers 
which change with each journey. To overcome this difficulty a translation facility will 
be provided to allow calls to functional numbers to be forwarded to the most 
appropriate personal number at that time. Thus calls made to a train number are 
forwarded by the network to the appropriate driver or locomotive for that train at that 
time. (I) 
1.4.3.6 
A follow-me service will be implemented in the EIRENE network using the GSM 
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) facility to allow users to establish 
and terminate the forwarding of calls from a functional number to their personal 
number. (I) 
1.4.3.7 
Location dependent addressing: Train drivers need to be able to contact controllers 
and other staff at the push of a single button. As the train moves through different 
areas, controllers are liable to change. As a consequence it is necessary to provide a 
means of addressing calls from a train to certain functions based on the location of the 
train. (I) 
1.4.3.8 
The only source of location information available within the GSM network is the cell 
that the train is in. However, there are a number of external sources from which more 
accurate location information may be derived: (I) 
− 
on-train location systems; 


Page 
32 
 
PSA167D006-15
 
 
− 
trackside balises; 
− 
information from ground based systems. 
1.4.3.9 
Within EIRENE, the primary means of determining the location of a train for the 
purpose of location dependent addressing will be based on the cell dependent routing. 
This may be supplemented with additional information from external systems to 
provide a greater degree of accuracy. (I) 
1.4.3.10 Direct mode: Railway mobiles may support a direct communications mode whereby a 
mobile can communicate with all other railway mobiles in a local area without the use 
of GSM infrastructure. Such a mode is required for use where: (I) 
− 
no GSM infrastructure is provided; 
− 
GSM infrastructure equipment has failed.

Alerting duration 
2.6.1 
The call waiting service (CW) permits a party A to be notified of an incoming call from 
party C whilst the traffic channel is not available for the incoming call and party A is 
engaged in an active call with party B. However call waiting does not operate during 
the prior set up of the call between the parties A and B (including alerting if used). 
Therefore the alerting duration has to be as short as possible in order to minimize the 
risk for the party A of missing notification of an incoming call from party C with a 
higher eMLPP priority. Taking into account technical and operational aspects, it is 
recommended to set the relevant timer(s) in the network in such a way that the 
maximum alerting duration is limited to 60s. (I)

3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 
EIRENE mobiles are specified to conform to a common minimum standard of 
performance. It is the responsibility of national railways to design their EIRENE 
networks to provide the required level of service to EIRENE compliant mobiles. (I) 
3.1.2 
This section draws together specifications and information related to the planning of 
an EIRENE network and provides guidance on target performance levels. Additional 
information on communication requirements for the ERTMS/ETCS application is 
provided in [ERTMS COMMS]. (I) 
3.2 
Coverage  
3.2.1 
For network planning, the coverage level is defined as the field strength at the antenna 
on the roof of a train (nominally a height of 4m above the track). An isotropic antenna 
with a gain of 0dBi is assumed. This criterion will be met with a certain probability in 
the coverage area. (The target coverage power level is dependent on the statistical 
fluctuations caused by the actual propagation conditions.) (I) 
3.2.2 
The following minimum values shall apply: (M) 
− 
coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 38.5 dBµV/m (-98 dBm) 
for voice and non-safety critical data; 
− 
coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 41.5 dBµV/m (-95 dBm) 
on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds lower than or equal to 220km/h. 
3.2.3 
The following minimum values are recommended: (I) 
− 
coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 44.5 dBµV/m (-92 dBm) 
on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds above 280km/h; 
− 
coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level between 41.5 dBµV/m and 
44.5 dBµV/m (-95 dBm and –92 dBm) on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds 
above 220km/h and lower than or equal to 280km/h. 
3.2.4 
The EIRENE mobile installation shall be designed to operate in a network meeting the 
criteria in 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. (M) 
Note 1:  The specified coverage probability means that with a probability value of at 
least 95% in each location interval (length: 100m) the measured coverage level 
shall be greater than or equal to the figures stated above. The coverage levels 
specified above consider a maximum loss of 3 dB between antenna and 
receiver and an additional margin of 3 dB for other factors such as ageing. (I). 
Note 2: The values for ETCS levels 2/3 concerning coverage and speed-limitations are 
to be validated and, if necessary, reviewed after the first operational 
implementation of ETCS. (I)

3.3 
Handover and cell selection 
3.3.1 
The handover success rate should be at least 99.5% over train routes under design load 
conditions (as given in [EN 301 515, Index [30]]). (O) 
3.3.2 
To avoid the necessity for large cell overlaps to accommodate high speed train 
operations, optimisation of the handover process for such trains is considered 
necessary. Suitable algorithms will be tested and refined as necessary during the trials 
process. (I) 
3.3.3 
The proposed events for measurement of the start and stop of the handover execution 
at the mobile are: (I) 
− 
receipt of ‘handover command’; 
− 
receipt of ‘UA’ after ‘physical info’ on new channel. 
3.3.4 
There is a quality of service requirement for handover executions (eg a break of 10s 
would clearly be unacceptable to the user). 300ms represents our current best estimate 
of the QoS figure, although this will need to be confirmed through user trials. (I) 
3.3.5 
An additional option is available to reduce the handover break period, namely the use 
of the synchronous handover capability to reduce the break period to about 150ms. 
Synchronous handover requires the BTS transmissions in different cells to be 
synchronised by the system. Each authority can decide whether it wishes to use 
synchronised BTSs. (I) 
3.4 
Call setup time requirement 
3.4.1 
Call setup time requirement is dependent upon the eMLPP priority of a call [EN 301 515, 
Index [27]]. The required priority level for each call type is given in section 10.2. (I) 
3.4.2 
Call setup times as defined in the EIRENE FRS shall be achieved with authentication 
and ciphering procedures enabled. (M) 
Note: Authentication may be delayed if necessary to achieve the required call setup 
times.  
3.4.3 
In order to achieve these times the passage of the call through any networks external to 
GSM (eg from the GSM MSC to a controller linked by an ISDN connection) must take 
less than 250ms. (I) 
3.4.4 
Achievement of fast call setup times requires information in the setup message to be 
compressed. A maximum of 12 digits may be sent as mobile originator-to-dispatcher 
information. (I)

Network configuration 
3.5 
Frequency band and channel arrangements 
3.5.1 
The network shall operate in a sub-band, or combination of sub-bands, of the R-GSM 
band as defined in [EN 301 515, Index [35]]. (M) 
3.5.2 
The UIC frequency band for GSM-R is defined in [CEPT 25-09], [1999/569/EC] and 
[ECC(02)05]: (I) 
− 
876 – 880 MHz (mobile station transmit); paired with 
− 
921 – 925 MHz (base station transmit). 
3.5.3 
The carrier frequency is designated by the absolute radio frequency channel number 
(ARFCN), and is defined in [EN 301 515, Index [35]]. For carriers in the UIC frequency 
band the following convention shall be used, where Fl(n) is the frequency value of the 
carrier ARFCN n in the lower band, and Fu(n) the corresponding frequency value in 
the upper band: (M) 
− 
Fl(n) = 890 + 0.2*(n-1024) 
 
955 ≤ n ≤ 973 
− 
Fu(n) = Fl(n) + 45 
Frequencies are in MHz. 
3.6 
DTMF tones and signals 
3.6.1 
The minimum duration of a DTMF tone and the length of pause between tones 
generated by the network (DTMF sender) and needed for the DTMF digit recognition 
in the network (DTMF receiver) are specified in [3G TS 23.014, Support of Dual Tone Multi 
Frequency (DTMF) signalling]. (I)  
3.7 
Termination of VGCS/VBS calls 
3.7.1 
An entitled controller may terminate a VGCS/VBS call based on DTMF signalling [EN 
301 515, Index [4] & [5]]. (I) 
3.7.2 
The network shall terminate the ongoing VGCS/VBS call if it receives the 3-digit 
sequence “***” transmitted via DTMF signals. (M) 
3.7.3 
In order to minimise the discomfort caused by the DTMF tone added in the voice 
channel, the duration of the tone generated by the fixed line dispatcher shall be 70ms ± 
5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone. (M) 
3.8 
Muting and unmuting for VGCS calls 
3.8.1 
The muting and unmuting for VGCS shall be in line with [EN 301 515, Index [4]]. (M) 


Page 
42 
 
PSA167D006-15
 
 
3.8.2 
The network shall send the SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-ATT = 
T”1 [EN 301 515, Index [6]] to the mobile station of the talking subscriber if it receives the 3-
digit sequence “###” transmitted via DTMF or the group call SETUP message2 from a 
controller terminal. However, receiving the 3-digit sequence “###” or the group call 
SETUP message related to an additional controller while any other controller is talking 
shall not result in sending another SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-
ATT = T”. (M)  
3.8.3 
When the network has detected the 3-digit DTMF sequence “###” transmitted via 
DTMF from a controller terminal and if the controller was not previously talking it 
should indicate its recognition by playing a single DTMF grant tone “#” of duration of 
100ms ± 5ms to be sent to that controller terminal only. (O) 
3.8.4 
The network shall send the SET-PARAMETER message with the attribute “D-ATT = 
F”3 [EN 301 515, Index [6]] to the mobile of the talking subscriber only if it has received the 
3-digit sequence “#**” transmitted via DTMF from all the talking controllers4. (M) 
3.8.5 
The duration of each tone (see 3.8.2 and 3.8.4) added in the voice channel, shall be 70ms 
± 5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone. (M) 
 
 
 
                                                     
1 On receiving this message, the mobile of the current talking subscriber will stop muting the down-link, thus allowing 
the subscriber to hear the controller’s voice. 
2 In the case of a controller as a group call originator, joiner and re-joiner speaking for the first time. 
3 On receiving this message, the mobile of the current talking subscriber will resume muting the down-link, thus 
preventing the subscriber from hearing their own echo. 
4 This indicates that all of the controllers have indicated that they no longer wish to speak (for example, by releasing 
their PTT buttons).

This specification defines three distinct mobile radio types according to the type of role 
they will perform and the environment they will operate in, as follows: (I) 
a) Cab radio - for use by the driver of a train and by ERTMS/ETCS; 
b) General purpose radio - for general use by railway personnel; 
c) Operational radio - for use by railway personnel involved in train operations such 
as shunting and trackside maintenance. 
Note: It is possible that the General purpose and Operational radios may have a 
number of physical implementations to meet railway requirements (eg handheld and 
vehicle mounted).

8.1 
General 
8.1.1 
Functional requirements relating to controller equipment specifications can be found in 
the EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification [EIRENE FRS]. (I) 
8.2 
Termination of VGCS/VBS calls 
8.2.1 
An entitled controller may terminate a VGCS/VBS call based on DTMF signalling [EN 
301 515, Index [4] & [5]]. (I) 
8.2.2 
To terminate a VGCS/VBS call by DTMF signalling, the 3-digit sequence “***” shall be 
used. (M) 
8.2.3 
In order to minimise the discomfort caused by the DTMF tone added in the voice 
channel, the duration of the tone generated by the fixed line dispatcher shall be 70ms ± 
5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone. (M) 
8.3 
Muting and unmuting for VGCS calls 
8.3.1 
Muting and unmuting shall be in line with [EN 301 515, Index [4]]. (M) 
8.3.2 
A group call controller who wishes to start talking (except in the case of an originator, 
a joiner or a re-joiner speaking for the first time5) shall indicate his wish, for example 
by pressing the PTT button, whereupon the 3-digit DTMF sequence “###” shall be 
transferred. (M) 
8.3.3 
The terminal of the controller should receive a single DTMF grant tone “#” of duration 
100ms ± 5ms sent by the network if it has detected the 3-digit DTMF sequence “###” 
and if the controller was not previously talking. (O) 
8.3.4 
Any group call controller who wishes to stop talking shall indicate his wish, for 
example by releasing the PTT button, whereupon the 3-digit DTMF sequence “#**” 
shall be transferred. (M) 
8.3.5 
The duration of each tone (see 8.3.2 and 8.3.4) added in the voice channel, shall be 70ms 
± 5ms, and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone. (M) 
                                                     
5 A controller as a group call originator, joiner and re-joiner speaking for the first time can speak directly without any 
indication of his wish.

9.1 
General 
9.1.1 
International standardisation of the numbering plan is required to ensure interworking 
between networks. Furthermore, standardised allocation of numbers to subscribers is 
likely to facilitate schemes for identification, barring etc. (I) 
9.1.2 
This section addresses the following: (I) 
− 
numbering plan requirements; 
− 
numbering plan limitations; 
− 
types of numbers; 
− 
EIRENE numbering plan; 
− 
short dialling codes; 
− 
group addresses. 
9.1.3 
The precise details of the numbering plan to be chosen for particular railways will 
depend upon the railway network configuration, its interconnection with other 
railway networks and its interconnection with public telecommunication networks. 
Equipment design must therefore be such as to give maximum flexibility in numbering 
arrangements. However, it may be generally assumed that numbers (excluding access 
prefixes) will not exceed 15 digits in length and will consist entirely of the digits 1 to 9 
and 0. (I) 
9.1.4 
Characters * and #  may be used locally to gain access to special facilities such as short 
code dialling. However, these arrangements do not form part of the network 
numbering plan. (I) 
9.1.5 
Procedures for handling the relationship between EIRENE Numbers and MSISDN 
numbers (ie registration, deregistration and re-registration) are specified in section 11. 
(I) 
9.1.6 
Each railway should have appropriate call-barring facilities to prevent unintended 
access to the GSM-R network by non-authorised users. (O) 
9.2 
Numbering plan requirements 
Use of Train Number 
9.2.1 
Within each GSM-R network, each Train Number shall be unique for the period of the 
journey. (M) 
9.2.2 
Every On-Train Function shall be identified by a standard code and shall conform to 
the list of functions given in Appendix 9A of this section. (M) 
9 
Numbering plan 


Page

PSA167D006-15
 
 
 
9.2.3 
All Train Function Numbers and their associated MSISDN numbers shall be stored in 
the same routing database, which is the database of the GSM-R network in which the 
train is currently operating. (M) 
Use of Engine Number 
9.2.4 
Every On-Engine Function shall be identified by a standard code and shall conform to 
the list of functions given in Appendix 9A of this section. (M) 
9.2.5 
The Engine Function Number(s) and associated MSISDN numbers shall at any time be 
stored as an entry in the routing database of the home GSM-R network6 of the engine. 
(M) 
Use of Coach Number 
9.2.6 
The Coach Function Number(s) and associated MSISDN number(s) shall at any time 
be stored as an entry in the routing database of the home GSM-R network of the coach. 
(M) 
Use of Shunting Team, Maintenance Team or Train Controller Number 
9.2.7 
Every Function shall be identified by a standard code and shall conform to the list of 
functions given in Appendix 9A of this section. (M) 
9.2.8 
The functional numbers of the Shunting Team Members, Maintenance Team Members 
and Train Controller (and any associated MSISDN numbers) shall be stored as entries 
in the routing database of the home GSM-R network. (M) 
Use of MSISDN number 
9.2.9 
Implementation of the EIRENE numbering plan shall not prohibit any authorised 
caller from using the MSISDN number where known, thus enabling mobiles to be 
assigned to particular personnel where this is appropriate. (M) 
Use of group call Service Areas 
9.2.10 
Service areas shall be defined within each railway network. (M) 
9.2.11 
The numbering of Service Areas for group calls and broadcast calls shall be made in 
accordance with GSM Technical Specifications [EN 301 515, Index [21] & [4]] and [EN 301 515, 
Index [22] & [5]] respectively. (M) 
                                                     
6  The home GSM-R network is the mobile network to which the mobile on the engine is subscribed.

Numbering plan 
9.3 
Numbering plan limitations 
9.3.1 
The EIRENE network can not be considered as a fully private network, as some parts 
of either the mobile or fixed networks may be provided by public operators. This leads 
to certain restrictions on the implementation of a numbering plan. These restrictions 
are given below. (I) 
Number allocation 
9.3.2 
To achieve integration of the EIRENE numbering plan with the national public 
numbering plan, telephone numbers have to be allocated by the various numbering 
regulatory bodies on a national basis. If functional numbers are to be used outside the 
EIRENE network, they will require either a public number allocation or, alternatively, 
an EIRENE Network Access Number (ENAN) may be used as described in 9.11 (I) 
9.3.3 
Each national railway should obtain a public numbering allocation for MSISDN 
numbers from the relevant regulatory bodies. (O) 
9.3.4 
The EIRENE numbering plan shall be standardised to allow interoperability and shall 
be implemented as a private numbering plan within the GSM-R network. (M) 
Use of alphanumerical numbers 
9.3.5 
In some countries Train Numbers are alphanumeric. These numbers do not comply 
with a numbering plan that can be interpreted by telephone switches and are therefore 
not supported by the call routing solution given in section 11. (I) 
9.3.6 
If alphanumerical numbering is required within a railway network, then these 
numbers may either be translated at the user terminal into a subscriber number or 
conveyed between the calling party and a routing database using a nationally 
determined approach. (I) 
9.4 
Types of numbers 
9.4.1 
Within the GSM-R network, the user shall be able to dial the following types of 
numbers: (M) 
− 
National EIRENE Number (NEN): this number is used to route a call from the 
calling party to a called party registered within the same GSM-R network; 
− 
International EIRENE Number (IEN): this number is used to route a call from the 
calling party to a called party registered within another GSM-R network; 
− 
MSISDN numbers: the number used by a subscriber of a public fixed (or mobile) 
network for calling a mobile station of a GSM PLMN; 
− 
Short Dialling Code (SDC): this number is used to allow ’speed dialling’ 
functionality.

PSA167D006-15
 
 
 
9.4.2 
In addition, Breakout Codes (BCs) shall be used to allow users within the GSM-R 
network to access external numbers. (M) 
9.4.3 
Access from the GSM-R network to external networks shall be as detailed in section 
9.10. (M) 
9.5 
Use of National EIRENE Numbers 
9.5.1 
National EIRENE Numbers are used to set up calls within a single GSM-R network. (I) 
9.5.2 
Every railway network shall consider a number as a National EIRENE Number (NEN) 
unless the number is preceded by an International Code, identifying another GSM-R 
network. (M) 
Structure of National EIRENE Number 
9.5.3 
The National EIRENE Number shall consist of three distinct parts, as shown in figure 
9-1: (M) 
 
 
Figure 9-1: National EIRENE Number structure 
1) Call Type: 
The Call Type (CT) prefix is used to distinguish between the different types of 
User Numbers that are allowed within the national EIRENE numbering plan. It is 
an indication to the network of how to interpret the number dialled. (I) 
2) User Identifier Number: 
The User Identifier Number (UIN) shall be one of the following numbers (as 
identified by the CT): (M) 
- Train Number (TN): a number given to a train by operational staff for a 
particular journey. This number shall be unique for the duration of the journey.

Note. For certain Train Numbers (e.g. 1234 and 123), a risk exists when dialling 
a number by keying in individual digits e.g. by the dispatcher. In this 
circumstance the risk of connecting to an un-intended train exists if there is a 
delay between keyed-in digits.  There is no risk of ambiguity if block dialling is 
employed. 
− 
Engine Number (EN): a unique number given to a tractive unit to identify it 
permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform identification marking system 
for tractive stock crossing frontiers [UIC 438-3]. In order to call a particular 
locomotive, it shall be possible to call a number associated with the tractive 
unit's stock number. The actual number of the unit, which shall be used as the 
EN, is based on the complete identification number. 
− 
Coach Number (CN): a unique number given to a coach (which is not a tractive 
unit) to identify it permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform 
identification marking for passenger rolling stock [UIC 438-1]. In order to call a 
particular coach it shall be possible to call a number associated with the vehicle 
marking. The total vehicle marking consists of 12 digits. The actual number of 
the coach is denoted by seven digits (positions 5 to 11 of the complete vehicle 
marking), which shall be used as the CN7.

3) Function Code: 
The Function Code (FC) is used as an identification of, for example, the person or 
equipment on a particular train, or a particular team within a given area.

This prefix defines how to interpret the User Number that follows. It shall consist 
of one or two digits as defined in table 9-1. 
 
                                                     
7 In order to prevent duplication of numbering, as each railway is free to allocate the coach number 
leading to number uniqueness per country only, the Owning or registering Railway code should be 
added as the first digits.

10.1 
Introduction 
10.1.1 
In order to provide a consistent level of service in each railway network and, in 
particular, to ensure interoperability for train drivers and other users roaming between 
networks, it is important to harmonise subscription details and other information 
stored in the network. (I) 
10.1.2 
For the purposes of defining common subscription profiles, a number of subscription 
types might be used, for example: (I) 
− 
Cab radio; 
− 
on-train radio; 
− 
controller; 
− 
trackside worker; 
− 
general staff; 
− 
data systems; 
− 
administration/management. 
10.2 
Allocation of priorities  
10.2.1 
In order to provide a consistent international service, it is necessary to ensure that 
priorities are allocated consistently across all railways. The following allocation of UIC 
priority levels to eMLPP priority codes is mandatory: (M)

10.2.2 
Levels 0 – 4 are designed to interwork with the ISDN MLPP service. (I) 
10.3 
Access classes 
10.3.1 
User access classes are defined in GSM so that under critical conditions, part of the 
user population can be barred from accessing the network in order to avoid 
congestion. However, such barring can be overridden by a user being a member of one 
or more of the following special access classes: (I) 
11 
open to network operator; 
12 
security services; 
13 
public utilities; 
14 
emergency services; 
15 
network operator staff. 
10.3.2 
Access classes should not be used under normal network operating conditions, where 
the GSM eMLPP may be used to provide a better grade of service to certain users. (O)

Subscriber management 
10.3.3 
For consistent working on public networks and in international roaming, the use of 
access classes in a railway network shall comply with the GSM specification. (M) 
10.3.4 
If special access classes (eg 12 - 14) are assigned within a railway’s network to certain 
high priority users, it ought to be noted that when roaming, this will only have an 
effect on a national public network, subject to bilateral agreement. (I) 
10.4 
Closed user groups 
10.4.1 
Closed User Groups (CUGs) may be employed by railways as an additional security 
measure. Such facilities may be particularly important if public network access to the 
radio system is provided (eg to prevent members of the public calling drivers and 
drivers calling members of the public). (I) 
10.4.2 
Any implementation of CUGs must take account of requirements for interoperability. 
(M)  
10.5 
Network selection  
10.5.1 
SIM cards shall contain a list of authorised networks so that networks shall be 
displayed (or automatically selected if automatic network selection has been enabled) 
in the following order of priority (see [MORANE SIM] for more details): (M) 
− 
home EIRENE network; 
− 
‘foreign’ EIRENE networks; 
− 
non-EIRENE networks (with order of priority predetermined by virtue of 
international subscriptions and roaming agreements). 
10.5.1i 
In order to shorten the duration of the network selection procedure, Mobile Stations 
designed for use in EIRENE networks shall give preference to the GSM frequency 
band allocated for railway use (see 3.5.2). (M) 
10.5.2 
The use of “Over The Air” in conjunction with the SIM Application Toolkit [EN 301 515, 
Index [36]] to update SIM cards in the home network is recommended (see [MORANE SIM] 
for more details). (I)  
10.6 
Cell broadcast message identifiers 
10.6.1 
Railway mobiles shall be provided with cell broadcast message identifiers in order to 
accept SMS-CB messages. (M)

10.7 
Encryption and authentication 
10.7.1 
Encryption. Licensing of A5/x encryption algorithms is managed by the GSM 
Association. (I) 
10.7.1i 
In case of encryption, standardised ciphering algorithms shall be used. (M) 
10.7.2 
Deleted. 
10.7.3 
Mobiles shall be capable of operation using algorithms for all countries in which they 
need to roam. (M) 
10.7.4 
Authentication. Each railway is free to implement its own authentication algorithms 
without any resulting loss in cross-border interoperability. (I) 


PSA167D006-15

11.1 
Introduction 
11.1.1 
There is a requirement to be able to address communications to a ‘functional number’ 
rather than a more permanent subscriber number. Such numbers are generally only 
associated with a user for a limited period of time. (I) 
11.1.2 
This is an important issue which will affect interoperability and the ability to use 
public network services. There are specific features of individual railways which make 
it difficult to develop a concise and universally acceptable system within GSM. (I) 
11.1.3 
To accommodate the different requirements of the individual railways, the following 
approach has been adopted: (I) 
− 
all responsibility for handling addressing lies with the network infrastructure and 
other ground based equipment, rather than additional functionality in the mobile; 
− 
each railway will be responsible for implementing addressing schemes which best 
meet its needs; 
− 
national addressing schemes are to use the internationally standardised ground-
train protocol, based on a single standardised GSM service, for exchanging 
information between the ground and mobiles. 
11.2 
Ground-train addressing 
11.2.1 
The ground-train addressing can be divided into two areas: (I) 
− 
functional addressing of mobile users; 
− 
location dependent addressing of fixed network users. 
11.2.2 
The first is related to passing information to provide an association between a mobile’s 
subscriber number and its functional number. The latter is concerned with ensuring 
that calls from a mobile terminal (in particular, Cab radios) are routed to the correct 
destination (ie primary controller, secondary controller), based on the current location 
of the mobile. (I) 
11.2.3 
The numbering plan to be used with functional addressing shall be in accordance with 
the numbering plan given in section 9. (M) 
11.3 
Functional numbering 
General 
11.3.1 
Functional numbering provides the mechanism by which a mobile terminal, or an item 
of equipment connected to a mobile terminal, can be addressed by a number 
identifying the function for which it is being used. (I) 
11 
Functional numbering and location dependent addressing 


Page 112 
 
PSA167D006-15
 
 
 
11.3.2 
Mobile access to the functional numbering scheme for registration, deregistration and 
re-registration shall apply the USSD messages and protocols over the air interface as 
specified in the GSM Follow-me service. (M) 
11.3.3 
The implementation of functional numbering at a network level is left open for 
national railways subject to the requirements for interconnecting EIRENE networks 
identified in section 11.6. (I) 
11.3.4 
Further information may be obtained from [MORANE SSRS, MORANE FA FFFS, MORANE FA 
FIS]. (I) 
Functional number management 
11.3.5 
For communication over the (Um) air interface, the USSD messages and protocols as 
specified in the GSM Follow-me service shall be used to manage the following types of 
functional numbers: (M) 
− 
Train number; 
− 
Engine number; 
− 
Coach number; 
− 
Shunting team number; 
− 
Maintenance team number. 
11.3.6 
It shall be possible to limit user access to functional number registration and 
deregistration facilities based on each of the types of functional number identified in 
11.3.5. (M) 
11.3.7 
Mobile stations shall use the following sequences for the control of the functional 
number management: (M) 
 
Procedure 
Sequence 
Interrogation 
*#214*SI***#

Where SI Supplementary Information represents the  International Functional Number 
(also called the International EIRENE Number), as defined in section 9.6.3. 
Note: This table is for information only. The Follow Me service control sequences are 
based on the USSD specified in [EN 301 515, Index [15]].

(M) 
11.3.9i 
In the event of a registration procedure failing owing to the functional number already 
being registered to another mobile, the Cab radio shall be capable of providing the user 
with the ability to perform automatically the forced de-registration of the previously 
registered mobile and the registration of this functional number to the user’s mobile. 
This shall result in the following sequence of actions being performed by the user’s 
Cab radio (see 11.3.7 for details of message structure): (M) 
1. Send interrogation message (from mobile to network). 
2. Receive MSISDN (from network to mobile). 
3. Send a forced de-registration message (from mobile to network). 
4. Receive the answer (from network to mobile). 
5. Send a registration message (from mobile to network). 
6. Receive the answer (from network to mobile).

[34]]. (M) 
Re-registration 
11.3.13 Re-registration consists of a registration procedure followed by a deregistration 
procedure. (I) 
11.3.14 Re-registration of on-train functional numbers based on the train number shall be 
performed every time a train leaves one EIRENE network and enters into another 
EIRENE network. (M) 
11.3.15 Deregistration of a functional number shall not be carried out until registration of the 
functional number has been carried out and confirmed as being successful. (M) 
11.3.16 Each railway should define a suitable time-out interval to be applied as part of the 
deregistration procedure for on-train functional numbers. (O)

13.1 
Introduction 
13.1.1 
This section covers the use of the EIRENE radio system for Railway emergency calls. 
The section also discusses the facility for confirmation of such emergency calls and the 
storage of confirmation for post-incident analysis. (I) 
13.1.2 
A Railway emergency call is a high priority call for informing drivers, controllers and 
other concerned personnel of a level of danger requiring all Railway movements in a 
pre-defined area to stop. Two types of Railway emergency calls are defined: (I) 
- 
Train emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst not involved in Shunting 
operations); 
- 
Shunting emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst involved in Shunting 
operations). 
13.1.3 
This section describes the handling of high priority voice calls for Railway operational 
emergencies and does not cover public emergency calls (ie handling of ‘112’ calls). (I) 
13.2 
Provision of Railway emergency calls 
13.2.1 
Railway emergency calls are defined as those calls of ‘Railway emergency’ priority (see 
section 10) which are routed to a pre-defined user or group of users due to a railway 
operational emergency. (I) 
13.2.2 
All Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using GSM VGCS (Specifications 
[EN 301 515, Index [21] & [4]]). (M) 
13.2.3 
It shall be possible to configure Railway emergency group call areas to contain 
combinations of cells controlled by one or more MSC(s) within one or more network(s). 
(M) 
13.2.4 
Where Railway emergency group call areas are controlled by more than one MSC 
within one or more network(s), a unique anchor MSC is defined for each group call 
area. (I) 
13.2.5 
For international Railway emergency calls, in order to minimise call set-up times, it is 
recommended that the anchor MSC always directly controls the cell where the Railway 
emergency call was originated. (I) 
13.3 
Initiation of Railway emergency calls 
13.3.1 
A Railway emergency call shall be initiated by using the appropriate function code for 
the required type of Railway emergency call (see Table 9-8). (M) 
13 
Railway emergency calls 


Page 122 
 
PSA167D006-15
 
 
 
13.3.2 
The call area and list of train controllers for each emergency group call will be fixed in 
the Group Call Register (GCR) of the anchor MSC. (I) 
13.3.3 
The Railway emergency group IDs required for interoperability are defined in section 
9.5. The composition of each group is a matter for national implementation, although 
all areas shall have a group defined for all mandated Group IDs. (M) 
13.4 
Receipt of Railway emergency calls 
13.4.1 
Each mobile shall store a list of emergency Group IDs in the SIM appropriate to its 
function (the Cab radio will store Group ID 299 and 599 - see table 9-8). (M)  
13.4.2 
All Railway emergency group IDs required for interoperability and appropriate to the 
operation of the mobile shall maintain active status whilst the mobile is powered up. 
(M) 
13.4.3 
The fixed network user will only receive emergency voice calls if designated a 
dispatcher or group member in any of the calls defined in the GSM GCR. (I) 
13.4.4 
On receipt of a Railway emergency call, the controller’s display should indicate the 
location of the train. (O) 
13.4.5 
If the requirement in 13.4.4 is implemented, as a minimum the location information 
shall be provided by the GSM network (eg current cell or base station serving the 
mobile). (M) 
13.4.6 
The mechanism for transferring the functional number of the originating mobile to 
controllers is defined in [EN 301 515, Index [6], Release 4] using the Information Element 
“Compressed OTDI” in the Immediate Setup 2 message from the originating mobile. 
(I) 
13.4.7 
If the GSM Release 99 capability and the Immediate Setup 2 feature defined in [EN 301 
515, Index [6], Release 4] are supported by the network, the network shall set the MSC 
Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information element to “1”. 
Otherwise, the MSC Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information 
element shall be set to “0” (zero) [EN 301 515, Index [41]]. (M) 
13.5 
Confirmation of Railway emergency calls 
13.5.1 
For post-incident analysis it is important that the initiation and receipt of Railway 
emergency calls by mobiles is confirmed by a message sent to a ground-based location 
(and also registered in the train borne recorder, in cases where a train borne recorder is 
connected to the Cab radio). (I) 


PSA167D006-15 
 
 
Page 123 
 
 
13 
Railway emergency calls 
13.5.2 
Not all calls require confirmation. The application must be able to deduce that a 
confirmation is necessary from the call priority, as all calls of ‘Railway emergency’ 
priority must be confirmed. (M) 
13.5.3 
Confirmation of Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using the User to User 
Signalling supplementary service (UUS1). (M) 
13.5.4 
After clear down of the Railway Emergency call, the mobile application shall start the 
confirmation process by automatically originating a call. In order to avoid network 
congestion the call set up shall be delayed by a random offset. (M) 
13.5.5 
Railway Emergency call confirmation messages shall be of eMLPP priority 4 - 
“Railway information and all other calls” (see section 10.2). (M) 
13.5.6 
The user information contained in the confirmation message shall be: (M) 
- 
Cab radio: the engine number or train number (if registered); 
- 
other mobiles: the user’s functional number (if registered). 
13.5.7 
Confirmation messages shall be sent to a confirmation centre using a defined short 
code (see table 9-10), which shall be associated with the GSM network. (M) 
13.5.8 
In the case of Cab radio, details of the confirmation shall be passed to the train borne 
recorder if a train borne recorder is connected to the Cab radio. (M) 
13.5.9 
The user-to-user information elements in the following messages, as defined in [EN 301 
515, Index [16]], shall be used for the confirmation of high priority calls: (M) 
− 
SETUP: transfer of confirmation message to confirmation centre; 
− 
RELEASE COMPLETE: acknowledgement of the confirmation message. 
13.5.10 The SETUP and RELEASE COMPLETE user-to-user information element shall be as 
specified in the [MORANE UUIE]. (M) 
13.5.10i Confirmation centres shall be capable of decoding messages in either format A or B.

Introduction 
15.1.1 
The operational requirement for direct mode is to: (I) 
1) 
provide short range fall-back communications between train drivers and 
trackside personnel in the event of failure of all railway and/or public GSM 
services normally available; 
2) 
provide short range communications for railway personnel operating in remote 
areas where no GSM facilities are available. 
15.2 
System requirements 
15.2.1 
Implementation of direct mode is optional. However, where implemented, the 
following requirements shall be mandatory. (I) 
15.2.2 
Frequency modulated equipment conforming to [ETS 300 086] shall be used for direct 
mode. (M) 
15.2.3 
Direct mode equipment shall have a maximum transmit power of 1 Watt. (M) 
15.2.4 
Direct mode equipment sensitivity shall be at least –107dBm. (M) 
Frequency range and mode of operation 
15.2.5 
Direct mode equipment shall be capable of operation in the channels defined in table 
15-1. (M)

CTCSS 
15.2.8 
Continuous Tone Coded Squelch Systems (CTCSS) shall be implemented on all direct 
mode equipment. (M) 
15.2.9 
The CTCSS tone shall be at a frequency of 203.5 Hz. (M) 
15.2.10 The CTCSS modulation shall be within the limits defined in table 15-2. (M)

Direct mode common access channel 
15.2.11 The purpose of the common access channel is to provide a point of contact and 
information for all direct mode users. For example, if one direct mode user wished to 
initiate contact with another user, communication would begin with a request for the 
desired partner on the access channel. After receiving a reply, both parties may transfer 
to a free direct mode channel and continue. (I)  
15.2.12 Direct mode channel 1 (876.0125 MHz) shall serve as the common access channel. (M) 
15.2.13 Equipment should default to operation on the common access channel (direct mode 
channel 1) on entry into direct mode. (O) 
Direct mode interaction with GSM-R 
15.2.14 Direct mode communications will only be used in the event of normal GSM-R services 
being unavailable. (I) 
15.2.15 The presence of the GSM-R network shall be indicated to direct mode users. (M) 
15.2.16 All terminals shall ensure that when GSM-R services are available, the user is 
prevented from entering direct mode. (M)  
15.2.17 In the event of GSM-R causing disruption to ongoing direct mode communications, 
each railway will define a protocol for re-establishing contact by means of GSM-R. (I) 
Shunting link assurance signal 
15.2.18 All direct mode equipment shall provide the facility to broadcast an in-band audio 
shunting link assurance signal as defined in subsection 14.4.2 of the [EIRENE FRS]. (M)
