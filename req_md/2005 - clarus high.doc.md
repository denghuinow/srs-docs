   Introduction


1 Purpose

      The purpose  of  this  requirements  specification  is  to  provide  a
      repository for the high level requirements governing the design of the
      Clarus system. These requirements capture the  expression  of  general
      needs in the  Clarus  Concept  of  Operations  and  in  meetings  with
      potential users and participants. These requirements will  be  further
      refined and expanded as the project progresses and will form the basis
      for the design verification and validation of the system. The intended
      audience for this document  includes  decision  makers,  stakeholders,
      designers, and testers.

      This document may be updated periodically to reflect  changes  in  the
      system  requirements,  including  changes  reflected   in   subsequent
      versions of the system.


2 Scope

      Clarus  is  an   initiative   sponsored   by   the   Federal   Highway
      Administration  (FHWA)   to   organize   and   make   more   effective
      environmental and road condition observation capabilities  in  support
      of four primary motivations.

        1) Provide a North American resource to collect,  quality  control,
           and make  available  surface  transportation  weather  and  road
           condition   observations   so   that   State   Departments    of
           Transportation (DOTs) can  be  more  productive  in  maintaining
           safety and mobility on all roads.

        2) Surface transportation-based weather observations  will  enhance
           and extend  the  existing  weather  data  sources  that  support
           general purpose weather forecasting for the protection  of  life
           and property.

        3) Collection of  real-time  surface  transportation-based  weather
           observations will support  real-time  operational  responses  to
           weather.

        4) Surface  transportation-based  weather  observations  integrated
           with existing observation data will permit broader  support  for
           the  enhancement  and  creation  of  models  that  make   better
           predictions in the  atmospheric  boundary  layer  and  near  the
           Earth’s surface to support more accurate forecasts.

      The intent of the Clarus Initiative is to demonstrate how an open  and
      integrated approach to observational data management can  be  used  to
      collect,   control   the   quality   of,   and   consolidate   surface
      transportation environmental data. The Clarus Initiative will  address
      the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a  multitude
      of independent  data  collection  systems.  This  process  offers  the
      prospect of enhancing data  coverage,  improving  the  performance  of
      meteorological support services, and providing guidance to  owners  of
      these data sources regarding the quality of their data and performance
      of their data collection systems.

      Clarus  represents  the  next  step  in  bringing   together   surface
      transportation best  practices  and  the  greater  weather  community.
      Surface transportation environmental  data  collected  by  the  Clarus
      system will include atmospheric data, pavement data[1], and hydrologic
      (water level) data.

      The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components.

    • The first component is the  development  of  the  Clarus  system  –  a
      network for  sharing,  quality  controlling,  and  exchanging  surface
      environmental data and relevant surface transportation conditions.

    • The second component is the development of  tools  (such  as  decision
      support systems) that make effective use of the Clarus system.

      The addition of Clarus system data to  national  weather  observations
      will further enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing  a
      wider range of benefits to the protection of life and property.

      Data from the Clarus system will have a wide  variety  of  direct  and
      indirect uses. Users having the most immediate contact with the Clarus
      system will include the owners and operators of the observing  systems
      that are providing information to the Clarus system, as  well  as  the
      users directly accessing the data contained within the Clarus  system.
      The following is an initial list —  which  will  likely  grow  as  the
      initiative progresses — of these stakeholders:

    • Observation system owners including federal, state, local, and private
      institutions;

    • Instrument and observation platform suppliers;

    • Direct data users including system owners and their contractors;

    • Surface transportation weather service providers  (which  may  include
      the observation system owners);

    • The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA);

    • General weather service providers;

    • Research community; and

    • Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests.

      The deployed Clarus system is envisioned to include:

    •  A  one-stop  Internet   portal   for   all   surface   transportation
      environmental observations;

    • Data provided without post-processing, ready to be  incorporated  into
      value-added products including weather and traffic models as  well  as
      decision support systems;

    • Continuous quality control of data with feedback to operators  of  the
      originating sensor stations;

    • Data transferred in one common protocol with full metadata;

    • Management  of  user’s  rights  to  input  or  extract  specific  data
      components;

    • Data retrieval tools; and

    • Support for the inclusion of new technologies  such  as  vehicle-based
      sensors, surface visibility  information  from  traffic  cameras,  and
      remote sensing technologies.

5 Overview

      The organization and content of this document is  generally  based  on
      the IEEE standards for System Requirements Specifications  (Ref.  13).
      The requirements presented in this document represent the  high  level
      objectives, constraints, and desires for the Clarus system.

      Each requirement is identified by a unique Clarus-specific  identifier
      to allow  the  requirement  to  be  referenced  in  future  documents,
      providing traceability throughout the development process.

      A requirements document states what must be  accomplished  to  fulfill
      the vision described in a concept of operations. It does not state how
      it is to be accomplished. This document describes each requirement and
      the basis for inclusion of that requirement.

      The remaining sections of the document contain  the  requirements  for
      the system. The sections and their content are as follows:

           Section 2 – General Description provides a general  overview  of
           the entire system. This section describes  the  general  factors
           that affect the system and its requirements.

           Section 3 –  Specific  Requirements  contains  the  requirements
           developed   from   reference   documentation   and   stakeholder
           communications. This section  organizes  the  requirements  into
           categories that facilitate the system development  process.  The
           categories  in  this  document  are:  Functional   Requirements,
           Performance Requirements, and Organizational Requirements.



   General Description

      This section provides an overview of the entire system  and  describes
      the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.  This
      section does not state specific requirements, but instead is  intended
      to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them  context.
      That context  and  the  overall  intent  of  the  Clarus  program  are
      described in detail in the Clarus Concept  of  Operations  (Ref.  12),
      from which much of  the  description  in  this  section  was  derived.
      Descriptions of specific terms and acronyms used in this  section  may
      be found in Appendix A.


1 System Perspective

      The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create  a  “network  of
      networks” — much  like  the  Internet  —  for  surface  transportation
      environmental data.  While  the  Internet  is  an  interconnection  of
      computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of  environmental
      (weather,  pavement,  and  water  level  condition)  data   collection
      networks. Each of the weather  networks  will  function  autonomously;
      they will collect information and disseminate  it  internally  without
      direction or dependence on Clarus.

      Each participating weather network’s connection to Clarus will add two
      new possible modes of functionality. First, the  participant  will  be
      able to  share  collected  environmental  data  with  Clarus.  Second,
      participants will be able to receive environmental data  collected  by
      Clarus. The primary recipients of this data will  be  weather  service
      providers, but any Clarus participants would be able to  receive  data
      if  they  so  chose.  This  concept  of  autonomous  data  sharing  is
      comparable to  the  World  Wide  Web  layer  of  the  Internet,  where
      organizations can publish information on  web  pages,  or  browse  and
      download information published by  other  organizations  on  the  web.
      Ownership of the data is retained by the  organization  that  provided
      the data to Clarus, and the provider  organization  can  restrict  the
      dissemination of the data through data  sharing  agreements  with  the
      Clarus program.

      The Clarus system will add a third mode of functionality, which  might
      be called “meta-librarian.” The Clarus system will collect,  organize,
      and qualify the environmental data to be published by the system.  The
      data will be collected from the participants,  organized  by  location
      and type of data, and quality flags will be added. When this is  done,
      the data  will  be  published  to  the  Service  Providers  and  other
      participant/consumers in Clarus. Figure 1 shows the general process as
      data  progresses  from  collection  through  publication  to   service
      providers.

                                    [pic]


       Figure 1 – Clarus Data Acquisition, Processing, and Publication

      The principal interfaces that will  be  critical  to  Clarus  are  the
      interface between Clarus and the  participating  collectors,  and  the
      interface between Clarus  and  the  participating  service  providers.
      While the service provider interface is completely within the  control
      of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the  collectors  may  be
      influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.

      While the participants want to access the network through “a  one-stop
      internet portal for all surface transportation  weather  and  pavement
      related observations” (Ref. 12), there  is  no  requirement  that  the
      system be a single centralized system. Designers are free  to  explore
      centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces
      with participants give the appearance of a “one-stop” portal.

      The issues of data retention  and  archive  are  also  not  explicitly
      addressed. While some data retention is  likely  to  be  necessary  to
      support the quality control function  and  the  publication  function,
      there is a clear recognition that as the data age, they lose value  to
      all but climatological investigators and other researchers. This phase
      of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of
      environmental data in Clarus. Considering the technical scope of  such
      an effort, archiving may be externalized  or  be  deferred  until  the
      Clarus network is operational and proven.


2 System Functions

      The  Clarus  system  will  collect  data  from  contributing  members,
      organize and qualify the data, and then publish the data  for  use  by
      service providers and  other  members  of  the  network.  These  basic
      processes are shown in Figure 2 in terms of Clarus system objects  and
      their interactions. The ellipses represent  specific  types  of  data,
      user roles, or equipment, and the arrows  represent  the  interactions
      between them[2]. For example, a “Collector”  administers  a  “Sensor”,
      collects “Observation Data”, provides “Sensor Metadata”, and  receives
      “Quality Feedback”.




                                                                       [pic]


            Figure 2 – Basic Clarus System Objects and Functions

      The volume of data involved in  this  process  has  the  potential  to
      become  very  large,  which  leads  to  a  significant  challenge   in
      developing  a  system  that  can  effectively  gather,  organize,  and
      disseminate the data. The Clarus system should be  a  data  collection
      system capable of handling a vast range of data in a  flexible  manner
      that permits new data types to be added.

      Determining  data  types  will  be  a  significant  challenge.  Proper
      understanding of the available data versus  the  required  information
      will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database  itself
      should be designed for greatest efficiency.

      While there are  many  types  of  environmental  data  that  could  be
      collected, the Clarus emphasis on surface weather  and  transportation
      puts the focus on those weather elements that have a direct bearing on
      surface transportation systems. These environmental data elements  are
      described in the NTCIP standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS)
      interfaces (Ref. 8) and summarized in Table 1.

      There are basic temporal  limits  for  the  data  collection,  quality
      control, processing, and publication of the environmental data.  There
      is also a  period  for  which  the  Service  Provider  Customers  have
      temporal-driven requirements.  The  design  of  Clarus  will  need  to
      consider these time horizons when planning the  technical  limitations
      of the system architecture. These data time horizons  are  illustrated
      in Figure 3.

                                                                       [pic]


                  Figure 3 – Time Horizons for Weather Data

      The average elapsed time for the Autonomous Layer varies as  a  result
      of configuration and communications latencies that are inherent within
      the operation of the system to collect the data. The Clarus  component
      includes the time required to communicate  data  from  the  Autonomous
      Layer to the Clarus system import process as well as the time required
      to process the  input  data  into  storage  structures.  Further,  the
      variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required
      to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the required human-
       and machine-based product generation. The average data age grows as a
      result of the aggregated times required to move  through  the  various
      layers and eventually to the Service Provider  Customers.  The  Clarus
      system design must  address  how  best  to  minimize  these  times  to
      optimize the flow of data in a timely manner.

      For the purposes of defining the boundaries of  these  time  horizons,
      the following definitions apply:

    • Average Elapsed Time is the estimated time for the  process  within  a
      given layer or layer sub-division to take place. The age  of  observed
      and recorded values can vary widely within these bands.

    • Average Data Age is the estimated average age of an ESS observation as
      it is transferred from the ESS to the end user.


3 User Characteristics

      Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a  wide
      audience. Because a variety of  users  can  derive  benefit  from  the
      Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have  the
      most immediate contact with the system components.

      The primary user classes include  the  owners  and  operators  of  the
      observing systems collecting and sending information  to  Clarus,  and
      the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.

      The following is an initial list of stakeholders whose user needs  are
      considered:

    • Observation system owners including federal, state, local, and private
      institutions;

    • Instrument and observation platform suppliers;

    • Direct data users including system owners and their contractors;

    • Surface transportation weather service providers  (which  may  include
      the observation system owners);

    • NOAA;

    • General weather service providers;

    • Research community; and

    • Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests.

      This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is  a  subset
      of the entire population of  stakeholders  interested  in  the  Clarus
      Initiative. The requirements of the broader stakeholder community  are
      essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a
      framework for the core Clarus system. From information in the  Surface
      Transportation Weather Decision Support  Requirements  (STWDSR)  (Ref.
      5), Weather Information for Surface Transportation  (WIST)  (Ref.  6),
      and 511 Deployment Coalition (Ref. 7) documents,  it  is  possible  to
      separate stakeholder groups into  a  condensed  list  based  upon  the
      user’s interface or interaction with Clarus data.

      The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring
      data from raw field observations to various levels of data  use.  This
      is illustrated in Figure 4.

                                    [pic]

                                    [pic]





        Figure 4 – Clarus User Layers and Time Horizon Relationships

      The Autonomous Layer is comprised of operational entities who  utilize
      weather and transportation data to make plans, decisions, and/or  take
      action based upon sensor data within their control. These data include
      observations collected by  ESS,  mobile  data  acquisition  platforms,
      cameras, and other  transportation-related  measurement  devices.  The
      Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority  of  the  raw  input
      data to the Clarus system.

      The Clarus Layer lies between the  Autonomous  and  Service  Providers
      Layers and  represents  the  nationwide  system  and  architecture  to
      accomplish the previously outlined  goals  of  surface  transportation
      environmental data collection and management.

      The Service Providers Layer is composed of  both  public  and  private
      entities that provide basic and value-added weather  support  services
      to support the  weather  information  needs  of  the  broader  surface
      transportation community. These support services rely on  Clarus  data
      (raw and processed) combined with other environmental, road condition,
      or traffic information products to develop  or  provide  road  weather
      information and enhanced products.

      The Service Provider Customer Layer  includes  those  groups  who  are
      direct consumers of products generated by Service  Providers  and  are
      generally not a direct user of Clarus data. The members of this  group
      could be anyone using  weather  information,  but  are  largely  found
      within the surface  transportation  community.  The  weather  products
      received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and
      non-Clarus data. In some  instances,  the  Service  Provider  Customer
      Layer includes entities and agencies also found within the  Autonomous
      Layer who  receive  quality  control  information  on  the  data  they
      originally provided to Clarus.

      Figure 4 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time  horizons  that
      separate the stakeholder groups. There  is  an  inherent  time  scale,
      similar to Figure 3, emanating from the center of the diagram outward,
      representing the flow and processing of data through the Clarus system
      and between the layers.

      The context diagram in Figure 5 illustrates the  relationship  of  the
      entities interfacing with Clarus. The diagram also describes the  flow
      of data between the entities and the Clarus system. The data  provider
      organizations maintain data collection  systems.  These  organizations
      make up the Autonomous Layer — the  primary  contributors  of  surface
      transportation data to  the  Clarus  system.  These  stakeholders  can
      benefit from Clarus by  receiving  quality-controlled  data  from  the
      Clarus system. This quality-controlled data are not value-added  data,
      but data with flags indicating  that  elements  do  not  meet  quality
      control thresholds.

                                                                       [pic]

               Figure 5 – Context Diagram of Clarus User Needs

      The private and public sector  Service  Providers  are  the  principal
      Clarus users. These Service Providers generate  value-added  road  and
      rail weather information services for  the  transportation  community.
      Additional Service Providers  having  direct  access  to  Clarus  data
      resources include research organizations, external agencies  that  may
      choose to archive Clarus  data,  and  other  related  weather  service
      providers.

      Within the context of Figure 5, the following roles can be assigned to
      each group of users:

    • Federal, State, and Local Agencies  –  These  are  the  transportation
      system and road weather information system (RWIS) operators and owners
      who directly provide the Clarus data. This group  places  considerable
      emphasis on  the  pavement-specific  component  of  the  data  at  the
      observational  level  to  make  immediate  decisions.   These   users,
      primarily maintenance and  operations  personnel,  are  the  principal
      consumers of information provided by  surface  transportation  weather
      service providers. Additional data from this group may include  closed
      circuit television (CCTV)  images,  road  condition  information,  and
      records  of  treatment  activities  such  as  plowing   and   chemical
      application.

    • Transit – These are the owners and operators of  transit  systems  who
      contribute raw data to the Clarus  system  and  may  receive  quality-
      controlled data from it. This group places  considerable  emphasis  on
      understanding weather conditions along designated routes.

    • Rail – These  are  the  owners  and  operators  of  rail  systems  who
      contribute raw data to the Clarus  system  and  may  receive  quality-
      controlled data from it. This group places  considerable  emphasis  on
      understanding weather conditions along designated routes plus weather-
      induced specifics such as  rail  temperatures,  frozen  switches,  and
      drifting snow.

    • Vehicle – Emerging technologies are developing that will  encourage  a
      greater level of data collection from  vehicles  for  the  purpose  of
      understanding the nature of the transportation system state  including
      the impacts of weather. As this method of data collection matures, the
      information  obtained  on  weather  and   pavement   conditions   from
      instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.

    • Surface Transportation  Weather  Service  Providers  (STWSP)  –  These
      surface transportation weather service providers are the  private  and
      public weather service providers who assimilate the Clarus  data  with
      other available data to generate  value-added  products  and  services
      used by the surface transportation decision-makers at state and  local
      transportation agencies.

    • Weather Service Providers – These include the weather support services
      that are primarily interested in  the  meteorological  and  hydrologic
      components of the Clarus data. This  group  includes  the  efforts  in
      public forecasting by NOAA and  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)
      along with private  sector  weather  services  and  their  value-added
      support  to  markets  such  as  agriculture,  power   utilities,   and
      construction.

    • Research – This category incorporates federal, academic,  and  private
      sector researchers who are working to improve the state  of  knowledge
      and practice through the research of surface transportation weather.

    • Archives – This  category  includes  operational  and  non-operational
      interests who choose to include the Clarus data  in  their  endeavors.
      The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with
      other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but  is  not
      restricted to such efforts.


4 General Constraints

      Timeliness of information and reliability  of  the  system  are  major
      constraints on the design. Both of  these  factors  can  be  addressed
      through appropriate system architecture and implementation.

      To address the timeliness factor, the system should be  designed  such
      that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a
      variety of sources and at potentially high rates. An architecture that
      spreads  its  data  collection  and  dissemination  processes   across
      multiple servers and communication channels may  address  this  issue.
      The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable  the  system
      to expand and add new data sources and end-users.

      Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment
      considerations.   Hardware,   operating   system,   and    development
      environment have significant impacts on the  inherent  reliability  of
      the system. To maximize system uptime, redundancies may be required at
      both the hardware and software  levels  of  the  system.  The  primary
      challenge  here  will  be  the  trade-off  between  the   desire   for
      reliability and the cost of redundancies.

      While the availability of the system is  covered  in  the  Concept  of
      Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed.
      Since Clarus is not replacing any existing application, the system  is
      not currently critical to any operation  or  transportation  function;
      neither is it intended to  support  any  “critical  national  security
      missions”.[4]

      The system shall be “open,” using an architecture  and  communications
      interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported  within  the
      information technology industry. The system should be standards based,
      where national standards are applicable. Special consideration  should
      be given to  the  national  intelligent  transportation  system  (ITS)
      standards.


5 Assumptions and Dependencies

      The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on  participation  by
      multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental  data
      consumers. While the system could be placed  in  operation  with  data
      from only a single contributing  network,  there  is  no  added  value
      without the participation of other  weather  data  sources.  Likewise,
      participation by a small number of data consumers  would  not  justify
      the cost of operating the system.

      Several assumptions have  been  made  about  how  long  it  will  take
      environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their
      data. Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited  use  to
      the data consumers. Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy
      of the data, and the ability of the contributing  systems  to  provide
      adequate location, time/date, and data qualification  tags.  Accepting
      data from contributors who cannot provide these  tags  with  the  data
      could  seriously  complicate  the  design  of  the  data   acquisition
      interfaces.

      Even though the system will check the data and  apply  quality  flags,
      consumers of Clarus-provided data will need to understand that neither
      FHWA nor the contributing data providers  will  accept  responsibility
      for the accuracy of any of the data. The  particular  limitations  and
      conditions  will  be  defined  in  data  sharing  agreements   to   be
      established with data providers, and disclaimer  information  will  be
      made available to data  consumers  by  whatever  means  the  data  are
      published.

      Several requirements deal with “regional”  needs,  without  specifying
      regional boundaries. It is unlikely that the regional boundaries  from
      contributing systems will  correspond  with  the  regional  boundaries
      defined  within  data  consumer  systems.  It  is  even  likely   that
      participating data contributors will have different  (though  possibly
      overlapping) coverage areas for their networks.  Data  consumers  will
      need  to  understand  that  data  will  be  presented  by   geographic
      coordinates, not by regional boundaries. Consumers will also  need  to
      understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor
      placement by the contributing organizations.

      The availability, format, and precision of  geo-reference  coordinates
      for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data
      acquisition system. Data in the system database and in published  data
      sets  will  likely  include  geo-reference  coordinates   in   decimal
      longitude, latitude, and elevation.

      The availability, format, and precision of time/date stamps could also
      present unusual problems for the data acquisition system, particularly
      if contributing systems cannot manage  Daylight  Savings  Time  (DST),
      span time zones, or span areas that do and do not participate in  DST.
      Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data  sets
      need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated
      Universal Time (UTC).

      The base assumption regarding “database tools” is  that  the  selected
      data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces,
      query tools,  and  configuration  and  management  tools.  No  special
      database tools will be developed as a part of the Clarus project.



   Specific Requirements

      This section presents  the  high-level  requirements  for  the  Clarus
      system and the associated institutional program necessary  to  achieve
      the needs and goals described by  the  Concept  of  Operations.  These
      requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of  the
      system as a whole and do  not  attempt  to  allocate  capabilities  to
      specific modules or subsystems within Clarus. This approach limits the
      high-level requirements in this document to those that can be  derived
      from a context diagram (Figure 6) that pictures the Clarus system as a
      single functional block with its interfaces. The types of requirements
      described in this section correspond roughly to  these  functions  and
      interfaces. Functional requirements describe what happens  inside  the
      Clarus system itself: quality control, development, and  packaging  of
      environmental data. Each interface to the Clarus system  has  its  own
      requirements: on collection of data from providers as  input;  on  the
      dissemination of  data  for  output;  on  the  controlling  rules  and
      constraints  under  which  the  system  operates;  and  on  the  means
      (primarily data management) by which it works.

                                    [pic]


                 Figure 6 – High-Level Requirements Context

      The  high-level  perspective  assumed  for  these   requirements   has
      implications for downstream  development  activities.  The  high-level
      requirements provide a basis for components in system elaboration, and
      detailed requirements are subsequently tied  to  specific  components.
      Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing  based
      on  plans  derived  from  the  detailed   requirements.   The   entire
      development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored
      in the high-level requirements.

      In this section, the  requirements  are  divided  into  the  following
      categories.

    • Functional Requirements – Lists the characteristics  that  the  system
      must support for each interface. Identifies what is to be done by  the
      system, what inputs should be transformed to what  outputs,  and  what
      specific operations are required. The functional requirements  further
      include:

               • Functional Data Requirements, which  describe  requirements
                 specific to the definition and management of data used  and
                 provided by the system; and

               •  Functional  Interface  Requirements,  which  describe  the
                 functional interfaces to the Clarus system from information
                 providers and consumers.

    • Performance Requirements – Specifies static and dynamic  capacity  for
      the number  of  users,  connections,  and  other  performance  related
      factors. Performance requirements further include:

               • Design Constraints, which identify constraints  imposed  by
                 standards, regulations, software or  hardware  limitations;
                 and

               • Quality  Requirements,  which  provide  requirements  which
                 address  the  general  quality,  usability,  extensibility,
                 flexibility, and maintainability of the system.

    • Organizational Requirements – Includes requirements for  policies  and
      procedures to support the implementation,  operations,  training,  and
      institutional requirements to support the system. This category also:

               • Details logical  characteristics  between  the  system  and
                 external data sources;

               • Specifies level of integration with  external  systems  and
                 defines the interfaces with each user class; and

               • Specifies any communications interfaces and protocols  that
                 should be supported.

      Table 2 shows the general  layout  of  the  requirements  tables,  and
      explains the purpose or content of each  column  of  the  requirements
      table.  The  requirements  in  this  document  are  a  subset  of  the
      requirements  information  that  will  be  tracked   in   the   system
      “Requirements Matrix.” While this document is intended to  record  the
      requirements that apply to a particular implementation of the  system,
      the Requirements Matrix  tracks  all  proposed  requirements  for  the
      system. The Matrix includes requirements  that  may  apply  to  future
      versions of the system or which have been  deferred  due  to  cost  or
      complexity.

      Table 3 provides an  explanation  of  the  requirement  identification
      numbering system.

      1 Functional Requirements

      This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must
      support. It also identifies what is to be done  by  the  system,  what
      inputs should be  transformed  to  what  outputs,  and  what  specific
      operations are required. The functional requirements are  broken  into
      subsections  by  general  functions,  data  functions,  and  interface
      functions.


1 General Functional Requirements

      The general functional requirements apply to the system  as  a  whole,
      without respect to specific functions or processes.

      2 Performance Requirements

      The requirements in this section specify static and  dynamic  capacity
      for the number of users, connections, and  other  performance  related
      factors. The performance requirements are divided into subsections and
      are provided in the form of design constraints, quality  requirements,
      and system performance requirements.


1 Design Constraints

      Design constraints apply existing rules or external conditions to  the
      system. Examples of design constraints  are  communication  standards,
      requirements for standardized hardware or software, and minimum  needs
      for a system to be useful.

|metadata        |In common information systems use, “metadata” is  |
|                |“data about data.” Within the meteorological      |
|                |community, this use has been extended to include  |
|                |data about objects related to weather             |
|                |observations. For example, location data for an   |
|                |ESS becomes metadata for the observation data.    |

[1] “Pavement data” in this context includes surface and subsurface data
specified in NTCIP 1204 (Ref. 8).

[2] The arrows in this diagram do not indicate data flows; they show the
subject-object orientation of the relationship.

[3] “Pavement” in this context includes bridges.

[4] Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance
of Reference 14, OMB Circular No. A-130, which, by its own definition, does
not apply to “critical national security missions.” Future applications of
Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification.
