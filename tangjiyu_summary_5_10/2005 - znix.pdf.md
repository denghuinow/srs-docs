# Project ZNIX - Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This software requirements specification (SRS) establishes the major requirements of the Project ZNIX research and development effort. Project ZNIX is an attempt to refine traditional information management systems to provide an object-based, application-independent retrieval and manipulation framework.

### 1.2 Scope
The SRS applies to the higher level design of the ZNIX Framework.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **ZNIX**: Not an acronym, suggesting the aspirant notion that a fully ZNIX integrated operating system could be the last major evolution for POSIX system.
- **ZNIX Framework**: Collection of system services (daemons) that facilitate user interactions with information and expose lower level functionality through a public API.
- **Client Process**: Software application that interacts with the ZNIX Framework by utilizing the public API or directly accessing information presented by the Framework.
- **Entity**: Basic block that builds up ZNIX's information hierarchy. First class citizens of the ZNIX Framework with unique and non-dependant identity.
- **Associate**: Similar to an Entity, differing in that its identity is dependant on at least one Entity. Removed from data store when last related Entity breaks relationship.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Project Perspective
Project ZNIX distinguishes itself from other information management systems by superior integration with the operating system. It envisions a world where users manage information by mastering information and its semantics rather than software applications.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Provide a centralized archive for user's information
- Provide hierarchical model for managing archived information with inheritance, association, or user-defined relationships
- Allow user to add, remove, modify or back up arbitrary pieces of information without disrupting hierarchy
- Assist user in building information hierarchy by automating data capturing and categorizing
- Provide simple API for developing ZNIX-aware client applications

### 2.3 User Characteristics
Browser GUI designed for casual users with little or no training. Target user-base includes home users, managerial staff, executives, and researchers with basic IT skills.

### 2.4 Constraints
Hardware: Intel Pentium III or compatible 1-GHz PC with 256 megabytes of RAM

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
System design assumes interfaces for 3rd party software listed in Table 3.9.3-A will be compatible with subsequent releases. Supporting listed software sufficient to serve intended user-base considering their popularity on Windows-based systems.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functionality

#### 3.1.1 Centralized Store for User Information
Framework must capture information from specified software tools and store in centralized data store. Framework may decide whether information should be stored as Entities or Associates.

Data capturing mechanisms:
- Personnel: Address Book creates Entities under "People" category
- Email (Outbound): Email intercepted before dispatch, Associate created for message body, recipient names create Entities under "People" category
- Email (Inbound): Email fetched from POP3 server, Associate created for message body, sender's name creates Entities under "People" category
- WWW Documents: User specifies research project start, project name spawns Entity, Associate created as archive linked to Entity
- Textual Documents: User invokes special GUI to draw relationships between document and Entities, document automatically saved reflecting relationships

#### 3.1.2 Hierarchical View of Information
User must view information in hierarchical manner. Framework includes browser capable of displaying hierarchy in UI similar to Windows Explorer, optionally integrated directly into Windows Explorer.

#### 3.1.3 Archiving of Information
User may archive portions to removable storage media (CD-ROMs and USB Pen Drives). Residue must be left on data store to indicate archived data. When user looks for archived Entity, Framework should inform user that Entity has been archived.

#### 3.1.4 Public API
Framework API exposes functionality to client processes:
- Create, delete and modify Entities and Entity groups
- Create, delete and modify relationships between Entities
- List and access Entities with API similar to standard file system API
- Execute queries for retrieval of Entities using different criteria

API exposing Entity listings may be designed similar to System.IO APIs of .NET Platform.

### 3.2 Usability
GUIs designed such that user with basic understanding of Windows 2000/XP operating systems would instinctively interact with them. GUIs may closely mimic popular Windows applications.

### 3.3 Reliability
Mean time between failures (MTBF) shall exceed 3 months.

### 3.4 Performance
- Framework may only operate in single user mode with no networking capabilities
- Framework Shell should not utilize more than 40 megabytes of RAM

### 3.5 Supportability
- Coding conventions must be documented before implementation phase and strictly adhered to
- Project ZNIX should be available in source and binary form, free of charge, hosted on popular Open Source distribution website
- Website must include provisions for users to make comments and compile wish-list of features

### 3.6 Security
- Framework must guard against malicious scripts on remote websites from accessing information
- Framework must guard against unintended corruption of information by user

### 3.7 Design Constraints
No design constraint imposed at this stage.

### 3.8 Online User Documentation
Online help system should utilize non-technical terms. Comprehensive Developer's Guide may be compiled to facilitate 3rd party ZNIX-aware applications.

### 3.9 Purchased Components
N/A

### 3.10 Interfaces

#### 3.10.1 User Interfaces
GUI capable of browsing information managed by Framework, similar to Windows Explorer. GUI must allow user to specify relationships between disparate Entities.

#### 3.10.2 Hardware Interfaces
System does not require special hardware interfacing.

#### 3.10.3 Software Interfaces
Provisions for following 3rd party applications to take advantage of Framework:
- Outlook Express 6.0: Email
- Outlook 2003 11.5: Email
- Address Book 6.0: Personnel Information
- Internet Explorer 6.0: WWW Documents
- Opera 7.5: WWW Documents
- Firefox 1.0: WWW Documents
- Word 2003 11.5: Textual Documents

Targeted operating systems: Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP.

#### 3.10.4 Communications Interfaces
Project ZNIX requires no communication interfaces at this stage.

### 3.11 Licensing Requirements
- ZNIX Framework licensed under GNU Library General Public License (LGPL)
- Browser and other tools released alongside Framework licensed under GNU Public License (GPL)

### 3.12 Legal, Copyright and Other Notices
All proprietary trademarks, product names and/or logos used are trademarks of their respective owners.

### 3.13 Applicable Standards
Components conform to:
- Windows 2000 Logo Requirements
- ISO 10646 (Unicode UTF-8) standards for character set encoding
- Optionally ISO 10646-1 (Unicode UTF-16) standards

System shall conform to these standards. Design may yield new standards for ZNIX-aware client processes.

## 4. Supporting Information
