# Tactical Control System (TCS) - System/Subsystem Specification

## System Overview
The Tactical Control System (TCS) is designed to provide military services with a single command, control, data receipt, data processing, data export and dissemination system that is interoperable with the family of all present and future tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These UAVs include the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV), Medium Altitude and Endurance (MAE) UAV (Outrider and Predator respectively), and High Altitude and Endurance (HAE) UAVs.

The TCS consists of software, software-related hardware, and extra ground support hardware necessary for the control of Outrider, Predator UAVs, and future tactical UAVs. TCS also provides connectivity to specifically identified Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems.

## System States and Modes

### States
1. **Startup State**: Includes Normal Startup Mode and Recovery Startup Mode
2. **Operations State**: Includes Normal Operations Mode, Training Operations Mode, and Maintenance Operations Mode
