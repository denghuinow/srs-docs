# Black Start Capability Plan (BCP) - CAISO

## 1. Overview
Following a complete or major loss of system generation (blackout), it is necessary to establish initial generation that can supply electric power to other system generation and begin system restoration. These initiating generators, referred to as system Black Start generators, must be able to self-start without any source of off-site electric power and maintain adequate voltage and frequency while energizing isolated transmission facilities and auxiliary loads of other generators.

From a planning perspective, a system Black Start Capability Plan (BCP) ensures that the quantity and location of system Black Start generators are sufficient and that they can perform their expected functions as specified in overall coordinated WECC BCP.

The CAISO may test Units designated to provide Black Start service (through an RMR or Interim Black Start Contract) by requiring the Unit to deliver Black Start service pursuant to a Test Dispatch Notice. Such tests shall be performed in accordance with the Ancillary Services Requirements Protocol in the CAISO Tariff. The CAISO shall not request a Black Start Test for a hydroelectric Unit during periods of constrained water availability.

## 2. Grid Planning
CAISO Black Start planning includes the following steps:

1. The CAISO determines the amount and location of Black Start Generation it requires through contingency studies that are used as the basis of the CAISO's emergency plans. The studies specify:
   - The initiating disturbance
   - The magnitude of the Outage, including the extent of the Outage
   - The assumed status of Generation after the initiating disturbance
   - The status of interconnections
   - The system Demand level at the time of the disturbance
   - The interconnection support and assumptions regarding availability of support from other utilities
   - The generator performance including a percentage of Black Start units expected to fail to start
   - Expected transmission system damage

2. The CAISO annually verifies that the number, size, availability, and location of system Black Start generating units are sufficient to meet WECC restoration plan requirements for the CAISO Balancing Authority Area.

3. The CAISO documents the Cranking Paths, including initial switching requirements, between each Black Start generating unit and the units to be started and provides this documentation for review to WECC upon request.

4. The CAISO Black Start planning evaluation process includes:
   - Diverse fuel resources for Black Start power for generating units
   - Available cranking and transmission paths
   - Communication adequacy
   - Unit capability of maintaining adequate regulation of voltage and frequency
   - Generator protection and control systems during abnormal conditions during system restoration
   - Limited energy resources (e.g., hydro, pumped storage hydro, compressed air) are selected sparingly

5. The planning evaluation process is coordinated, as appropriate, with the Black Start capability plans of transmission owners and neighboring Balancing Authorities.

6. The CAISO annually enters into RMR and Interim Black Start Contracts with generators that satisfy the results of the annual planning evaluation process.

## 3. Generator Unit Testing

### Black Start Testing Minimal Requirements
The following requirements apply to Voluntary Black Start units that desire a CAISO Black-Start status, Interim Black Start units, and RMR Black Start Units:

1. The owner or operator shall demonstrate at least every five years, through simulation or testing, that the unit can perform its intended functions as required by the WECC BCP and this testing section. Documentation of the test results and analysis must be submitted to the CAISO, WECC, or NERC upon request.

2. Within 24 hours of conducting a Black Start test, all Participants will notify the CAISO RT Dispatcher by phone indicating the success or failure of the test. Within 14 days of performing a Black Start test, all Participants will file a letter with the CAISO regarding the success or failure of the test.

3. Testing records shall include the dates of the tests, the duration of the tests, and an indication of whether the tests met the requirements of this Black Start Testing section.

4. The Black Start unit must have the ability to maintain voltage within emergency voltage limits over a range of loading from no external load to full external load in accordance with NERC reliability standards.

5. The Black Start unit must be equipped with governors that are capable of operating in an isochronous mode.

6. Adequate transmission capacity shall be available to connect the Black Start facility to the source providing station services to other specified generating stations.

7. The Black Start unit must be capable of starting and energizing the applicable transmission path without assistance from the electrical system.

8. The Black Start Test should include key operating aids used in Black Starts such as telephone communications and SCADA, if applicable.

9. The following start-up/synchronizing time limits shall apply:
   - Hydroelectric generating units or combustion gas turbines: within 30 minutes of the initiation of the Black Start process
   - Industrial gas turbines: within 60 minutes of the initiation of the Black Start process
   - Hot, steam-driven turbines: within 2.5 hours of the initiation of the Black Start process
   - For units in another reliability coordinator area or unspecified technology: specific start time limits are negotiated

10. The minimum run time duration (the generation time after being synchronized to the grid) of a Black Start test is 10 minutes.

11. Submit a CAISO market schedule for any test energy.

### RMR & Interim Black Start Testing Requirements
The following requirements apply only to CAISO RMR Black Start Units as well as to CAISO Interim Black Start Units:

1. All Black Start Generating Units must satisfy technical requirements specified by the CAISO.

2. The CAISO shall from time to time undertake performance tests, with or without prior notification.

3. The CAISO shall have the sole right to determine when the operation of Black Start Generating Unit is required to respond to conditions on the CAISO Controlled Grid.

4. The CAISO annually requests Black Start tests from at least one third of all RMR and Interim Black Start units.

5. Black Start units may be tested and/or assessed for the ability to self-provide start-up power for the period of time it takes to complete the start-up process at the generating station and to switch to the applicable transmission path and synchronize to the grid.

6. Black Start units may be tested and/or assessed for:
   - Ability to complete such number of successive starts within such period of time as may be specified in the unit's RMR or Interim Black Start contract
   - Its ability to produce the range of reactive power resources required by its voltage support section of the unit's RMR or Interim Black Start contract

## 4. Recordkeeping
The CAISO maintains a Black Start database that contains all Black Start generators designated for use during a system restoration. The Black Start database is reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis and includes the name, location, megawatt capacity, type of unit, latest date of test, and starting method.

If a Black Start unit did not successfully pass the CAISO Black Start criteria specified in this procedure, an explanation and a plan to address and correct the deficiency shall be provided to the CAISO by the generator owner/operator. The results of the testing and the justification for the periodicity of the testing shall be provided to WECC or NERC on request (within 30 days).

## 5. Training
Real-time Grid Operators are trained at least annually for system restoration including the use of Black Start capable units. The training encompasses the integrated coordination of:
- NERC requirements
- WECC requirements
- E-501 - System Restoration
- E-501A Black Start Capable Units
- Black Start Capability Plan
- Simulations of full or partial system shutdowns and restoration (including a critique report of the simulation)

As a system simulator becomes available the CAISO will conduct operator training for system restoration and Black Start unit use.

## 6. Definitions
- **Availability Test**: A test called by the CAISO or the RMR Unit Owner to establish and verify the RMR Unit's Availability Limit.
- **Black Start**: The ability of a generating unit or station to go from a shutdown condition to an operating condition and start delivering energy to the grid without initial assistance from the electric system.
- **Interim Black Start Unit**: A generating unit with Black Start capability that enters into an Interim Black Start Contract with the CAISO. This is not an RMR contract.
- **Participant**: Those generator owners or operators that desire to test their generating units for Black Start capability.
