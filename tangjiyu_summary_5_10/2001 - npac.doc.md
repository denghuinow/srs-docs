## System Overview
The NPAC (Number Portability Administration Center) SMS (Service Management System) is designed to manage and administer local number portability (LNP) services. It facilitates the porting of telephone numbers between different service providers and ensures the synchronization of routing information across the network.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Functional Requirements
- **Provisioning Service Functionality**: NPAC SMS shall receive customer information from both old and new Service Providers, validate the information, and download new routing information upon activation.^[1]^
- **Disconnect Service Functionality**: Handle the disconnection of ported numbers, updating the network databases accordingly.^[2]^
- **Repair Service Functionality**: Provide audit capabilities to detect and correct data inconsistencies.^[3]^
- **Conflict Resolution Functionality**: Manage conflicts between Service Providers regarding number porting, placing subscriptions in conflict status when necessary.^[4]^
- **Disaster Recovery and Backup Functionality**: Ensure system availability and data integrity during outages, with procedures for backup and recovery.^[5]^
- **Order Cancellation Functionality**: Allow cancellation of subscription versions and blocks, with appropriate conflict resolution.^[6]^

### 2. Data Management
- **NPAC Data Administration**: Manage ported telephone number information, including creation, modification, and deletion of subscription versions.
- **Service Provider Data Administration**: Store and manage Service Provider data, including contact information, security settings, and network interface details.^[7]^
- **Subscription Version Data Management**: Maintain detailed records of each ported number, including status, routing information, and timestamps.^[8]^
- **Network Data Management**: Store and manage network topology and routing data, essential for routing ported numbers to the correct termination points.

### 3. Number Pooling
- **National Number Pooling**: Implement a system to manage the allocation and de-allocation of 1000-block ranges of telephone numbers (NPA-NXX-X) among Service Providers.^[9]^
- **Block Management**: Handle the creation, modification, and deletion of number blocks, ensuring data integrity and synchronization across the network.^[10]^
- **Pooling Administration**: Support the Pooling Administrator in managing the number pool, including the addition and removal of blocks.

### 4. Interfaces and Protocols
- **SOA to NPAC SMS Interface**: Define a secure, open interface for Service Order Activation (SOA) systems to interact with NPAC SMS.^[11]^
- **NPAC SMS to Local SMS Interface**: Establish a protocol for NPAC SMS to communicate routing updates to Local Service Management Systems (LSMS).^[12]^
- **Interoperable Interface Specification**: Ensure interfaces are based on ISO standards, specifically ISO 10165-4, for interoperability.^[13]^

### 5. Security
- **User Identification and Authentication**: Require unique user IDs and strong authentication mechanisms for all system users.^[14]^
- **Access Control**: Limit access to system resources based on user roles and responsibilities.^[15]^
- **Data Integrity**: Implement measures to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data across the system.^[16]^
- **Audit Trails**: Generate detailed audit logs for security investigations and compliance purposes.^[17]^

### 6. Performance and Reliability
- **Availability**: Design the system for high availability, with fault tolerance and symmetrical multiprocessing capabilities.^[18]^
- **Performance**: Support a high transaction rate, with specific performance goals for message processing and download speeds.^[19]^
- **Scalability**: Allow for economical and efficient system expansion to accommodate future growth.^[20]^

### 7. Reporting
- **Report Generation**: Support the creation of pre-defined and ad-hoc reports for NPAC personnel and Service Providers.^[21]^
- **Report Distribution**: Distribute reports to authorized users via various output devices, including printers, electronic files, and fax machines.^[22]^

### 8. Tunable Parameters
- **System Tunables**: Provide configurable parameters for system behavior, such as retry intervals, timeout values, and data retention periods.^[23]^
- **Block Tunables**: Allow customization of block-related behaviors, including effective date windows and re-scheduling options.
