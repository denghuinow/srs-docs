# Grid 3D Application - Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Background
The Grid 3D Application is a visualization tool designed to display biological data in a three-dimensional environment. This tool addresses the need for researchers to investigate data and easily see various attributes at a glance, providing capabilities previously unavailable in existing visualization tools.

### 1.2 Goals
The primary goal is to enable users to visualize and investigate their data in a 3D environment, allowing them to see differences in various selected attributes of their data at a glance.

### 1.3 Stakeholders
- **Client**: Dr. Delmiro Fernandez-Reyes, supervisor at NIMR
- **Customers**: Parasitology department at NIMR and anyone in the research field who would find this product useful
- **Other Stakeholders**: Developer Ben Tagger, UCL supervisor Anthony Finkelstein, and everyone in the parasitology department at NIMR

## 2. Product Constraints

### 2.1 Solution Constraints
- Must be available on both Windows and Linux operating platforms
- Execution must be kept on the server side
- Must be developed within a specified time frame to be included in a scientific paper

### 2.2 Implementation Environment
- Should run on a minimum of a mid-range personal computer
- Must run with minimum input tools of mouse and keyboard
- Users must have capability for creating tab-delimited text files

### 2.3 Partner Applications
- Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, NT and XP Operating Systems
- Linux and Solaris Operating Systems
- Matlab for pre-product data generation and data format manipulation
- Tomcat/Apache/Ant for potential product deployment

## 3. User Characteristics
The product targets:
- Protein investigators
- Research Scientists
- Data-mining Scientists
- Research Students
- Organizations in this field

Users are expected to have:
- Basic computing skills for operating systems
- Ability to use Java-enabled internet browsers
- Competent use of keyboard and mouse
- Basic file handling capabilities
- Command line input skills

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Functionality
- Plot data points in a scientifically correct manner
- Label grid axis correctly according to input from data file
- Color data points according to cluster number contained in data file
- Handle up to 2000 data points
- Display data point name with single mouse click
- Display all data point details with double mouse click
- Allow multiple point selection for displaying multiple names
- Enable user orientation of grid through rotation, zoom, and move functions

### 4.2 Data Requirements
The application requires a data file containing:
- Name for each data point
- 3 parameters for plotting the data point
- Single parameter to designate point color (comparison attribute)
- Description for each data point

The first row of the data file must contain column headings in the format:
`Name, X_Title, Y_Title, Z_Title, Cluster_Title, Description`

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Look and Feel
- Points must be large enough to see and select but not so large as to distort overall pattern
- Axis must be clearly labeled and recognizable after grid orientation changes
- Application should be colored for clear printouts (black on white background)
- Interface must be intuitive and not require specialist training

### 5.2 Performance
- Program should start within 30 seconds (dependent on number of data points)
- Interaction with data points should have no longer than 2-second delay
- Response to orientation changes must be fast enough to avoid interrupting user flow

## 6. System Context

### 6.1 User Roles
- **Identifier**: Uses 3D view to demonstrate properties of data to others
- **Investigator**: Finds detailed information about specific points
- **Demonstrator**: Uses application to identify points of interest

### 6.2 Work Context
The application operates in two phases:
1. Initialization: Users supply data and receive initial views
2. Running: Users interact with the 3D grid through rotation, movement, zoom, point selection, and information retrieval

## 7. Definitions
- **Biological data**: Data of biological scientific nature generated by external processes, formatted for Grid 3D use
- **Grid 3D**: The application for which this document contains requirements
- **Identifier/Investigator/Demonstrator**: Different user roles with specific interaction patterns
