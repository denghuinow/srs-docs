# PHIN Outbreak Management - Functional Requirements

## 1. Introduction
The Public Health Information Network (PHIN) Outbreak Management (OM) functional area supports investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of health events or bioterrorism acts. OM systems should be configurable to meet different health event needs and capture data related to cases, contacts, investigations, exposures, relationships, clinical and environmental specimens/samples, laboratory results, vaccinations, treatments, travel history, and conveyance information. The application should allow for new objects to be defined and created during investigations.

Central to OM functionality is collecting data related to cases and exposures and creating traceable links between all appropriate entities. By tracing transmission mechanisms and identifying health event sources, response staff can more effectively contain events. OM systems should integrate with early event detection, countermeasure administration, laboratory, and surveillance systems.
