# 2000 - NASA X38

## Overview
The X-38 Fault Tolerant System Services (FTSS) is a software system designed for the avionics architecture of NASA's X-38 Crew Return Vehicle.^[1]^ It operates on a quad-redundant Flight Critical Computer (FCC) based on Draper's Fault Tolerant Parallel Processor (FTPP) architecture.^[2]^ FTSS provides an Application Programming Interface (API) between NASA's application code and the underlying hardware, ensuring fault-tolerant operations.

## Key Features
- **Fault Tolerance**: Provides fault detection, isolation, and recovery mechanisms for the FCC hardware.^[3]^
- **Scheduling Services**: Manages task scheduling across multiple rate groups (50 Hz, 10 Hz, 1 Hz).^[4]^
- **Communication Services**: Offers both synchronous and immediate message passing capabilities.^[5]^
- **Time Services**: Provides Mission Elapsed Time (MET) and Separation Elapsed Time (SEP) with high accuracy.^[6]^
- **Memory Management**: Implements memory protection, scrubbing, and realignment to handle memory faults.
- **Redundancy Management**: Maintains and reconfigures virtual groups in response to hardware failures.^[7]^

## Functional Requirements
- **System Initialization**: Configures FCC hardware and software, performs initial Built-In Tests (IBIT), and enables watchdog timers.^[8]^
- **Scheduling Execution**: Manages task scheduling and vehicle mode changes, ensuring deterministic task execution.
- **Memory Management**: Performs memory scrubbing and realignment to prevent memory faults from affecting system operations.
- **Fault Detection and Isolation**: Conducts initial and continuous BITs to detect and isolate hardware faults.^[9]^
- **Redundancy Management**: Reconfigures virtual groups and performs recovery actions in response to faults.^[10]^
- **Time Services**: Provides accurate MET and SEP with high resolution and drift rate control.^[11]^
- **Communication Services**: Ensures reliable message passing between tasks and virtual groups, both synchronously and immediately.

## User Characteristics
- **Application Programmers**: Utilize the FTSS API to develop flight-critical applications.
- **System Administrators**: Manage and monitor the FTSS system, including fault recovery and system reconfiguration.^[12]^

## Constraints
- **Hardware Specifications**: Operates on Radstone Power PC 604R with specific memory and ROM limitations.^[13]^
- **Software Environment**: Uses VxWorks Operating System version 5.4, compiled and linked with Tornado 2.^[14]^

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Scheduler and communication services must complete operations within strict time limits (e.g., 1 millisecond for scheduler overhead).
- **Accuracy**: MET and SEP must maintain high accuracy and resolution (e.g., 50 PPM drift rate, 20 millisecond resolution).
- **Fault Recovery**: Recovery actions must complete within specified time frames (e.g., 1.5 minutes for processor recovery).^[15]^

## Supportability
- **Documentation**: Provides API documentation, software user manuals, and release notes.
- **Training**: No specific training requirements identified.

## Interfaces
- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: Defined for FTSS software interaction with application code.
- **Network Element (NE)**: Provides fault-tolerant communication among virtual groups.
- **VxWorks Operating System**: FTSS operates as a task within the VxWorks environment.^[16]^
- **Multi-Protocol Communications Controller (MPCC)**: Interfaces with telemetry and command systems.^[17]^

## Licensing
- **Proprietary**: FTSS software is proprietary to Draper Laboratory and NASA, with specific licensing and distribution terms.^[18]^
