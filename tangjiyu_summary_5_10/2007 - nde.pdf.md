# NPP and NPOESS Data Exploitation (NDE) System Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This requirements specification identifies system requirements to support customer needs for products from the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) satellite and NPOESS satellites. These requirements serve as the primary focal point for traceability of all lower level requirements documented in other NDE deliverables.

### 1.2 System Overview
NOAA's NPOESS Data Exploitation (NDE) system receives data from the NPOESS Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS), processes and packages it to meet user requirements, ensures appropriate NDE unique products are archived, distributes data to authorized users, and provides customer service.

The NDE primary mission is to provide products derived from NPOESS observations to NOAA's operational and climate communities and other civilian customers.

### 1.3 Key Objectives
- Disseminate NPOESS Data Records from the IDPS to customers
- Generate and disseminate tailored NPOESS Data Records (alternative formats and views)
- Generate and disseminate NOAA-unique products (augmented environmental products constructed from NPOESS Data Records)
- Deliver NOAA-unique products and associated metadata to the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS)
- Provide services to customers including Help Desk, product training, enhancement, and implementation support
- Coordinate NPOESS-related activities across NOAA
- Develop a sustainable system that meets customer needs
- Provide software for NPOESS Data Record format conversion

## 2. System Environments
The NDE System is partitioned into:
- Operational (OPS) Environment
- System Test (TEST) Environment
- Development (DEV) Environment

Each environment is designed for specific purposes for both the NPP era and NPOESS C1 and C2 eras.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 System States and Modes
- **Open Mode**: Authorized customers allowed read-only access to requested Data Products (nominal system mode)

- Adjust priorities of scheduled and event-driven tasks

### 3.5 Data Management
- Store 4 Terabytes of data for testing purposes
- Report on all ingested, generated, and distributed data according to Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata
- Store product quality information in metadata of created products
- Retain Data Products for configurable period not to exceed 96 hours
- Generate backups for all NDE data, procedures, and software
- Implement automated backup procedures
- Return to nominal operations following restoration from system backups
- Protect data integrity from human errors, transmission errors, software bugs, hardware malfunctions, and natural disasters
- Access system only with government authorization

### 3.6 System Adaptation
- Accept technology updates without system downtime
- Add additional capacity without redesign of infrastructure

### 3.7 Computer Resources

- Construct system using COTS and Open Source software where possible, practical, and approved
- Design System Elements to be reusable in other Satellite Data Processing applications
- Design system so Scientific Algorithms are invoked as objects

### 3.8 Operator Functions
- Log and track events (MMC Service Requests, Responses)
- Update summary log for tracking significant events or activities
- Sort and search summary log events for identifying, troubleshooting, and reporting
- Report on summary log events
