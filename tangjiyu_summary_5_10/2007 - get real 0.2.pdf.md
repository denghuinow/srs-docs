# Get Real Website Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes requirements for the Get Real website (http://getreal.ous.edu) version 2, developed in summer 2007. The scope is limited to attracting and encouraging Oregon high school students to take coursework leading toward a baccalaureate degree in computer science (CS) at one of the seven Oregon University System campuses.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The website provides a high school teen-friendly set of web pages that are easy to navigate while providing sufficient depth and information about careers in computer science. Two potential groups of viewers exist:
1. Students interested in CS seeking more in-depth information about a CS career
2. College bound students not necessarily interested in CS who might be attracted to a CS career with the right "push"

The goal is to encourage more Oregon students to choose computer science and related majors, increasing the number of computer science graduates from Oregon universities. Maintaining a teen-friendly site is of highest importance.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
This product is an update of the existing Get Real website version 1. The new site will be version 2, with a potential future version 3 to incorporate ideas learned from version 2.

### 2.2 Product Features
Major features include existing pages/sections:
- Exploring College
- Jobs & Money
- Real People
- Women in Computing
- Resources
- I'm Looking For...
- Articles

Proposed new pages/sections:
- High School Courses
- Search for additional information
- Professional Organizations
- RSS feeds of current CS information
- Ask an Engineer, Ask a Prof – FAQ
- Consider a CS minor in other professions

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Users are typical Oregon high school students, grades 9 to 12 in ALL high schools across Oregon. Feedback from students indicated the need for design changes to all existing pages to shorten paragraphs and add bullets and charts to accommodate faster page reading and shorter attention spans.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The site runs as an extension of the OUS site (~getreal.ous.edu~) on OSU servers, maximizing Google and other search engine hits.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
Constraints include space, bandwidth for video streaming, and limited availability of Chancellor's Office resources.

## 3. Get Real Pages & Sections

### 3.1 Exploring College (existing)
A listing of computer science offerings from Oregon University System campuses and other Oregon colleges.

Focused questions and answers with links inside the Get Real site on topics including money, people, and colleges.

### 3.7 Articles (existing)
Articles outside the Get Real site including "50 best jobs in America, Dream Jobs 2007, etc."

### 3.8 High School Courses (new)
Recommended curricula for high school students interested in CS and related careers, with pointers to curricula recommendations from OUS campuses and other university sources.

### 3.9 Search for Additional Information (new)
Internal search of the Get Real site and external search of CS related outside sites such as OUS campuses and articles on CS.

### 3.10 Professional Organizations (new)
Listing with links to ACM, IEEE, and key sub groups such as SIGGRAPH, pointing to student sections of these organizations.

### 3.11 RSS Feeds of Current CS Information (new)
Selected articles from the chancellor's office daily communications distribution, fed to RSS subscribers on the Get Real site.

### 3.12 Ask a Grad or Prof – FAQ (new)
Fast feedback from the Oregon University System on questions asked in a Q and A format, with answers posted in an FAQ section.

### 3.13 Consider a CS Minor (new)
Information for students in medicine, law, business, and other professions about the high value of having a CS minor.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces
The site should work and be tested against IE, Firefox and Netscape.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
No special hardware interface requirements.

### 4.3 Software Interfaces
No special software interface requirements.

### 4.4 Communications Interfaces
No special communication interface requirements.

## 5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
The site should be hosted on a server that provides adequate response time. High school students have short attention spans, so a slow server would not be satisfactory.

### 5.2 Security Requirements
Copyright and other security measures should be the same as the OUS site.

### 5.3 Software Quality Attributes
Web design conventions should be consistent with the standards and conventions used on the OUS site. There is a need to track and evaluate the "hits" and time spent on the website over time, making content, design, and navigation changes as needed.

## 6. Version 3 Suggestions
6.1 Knowledge base development for future enhancements.
