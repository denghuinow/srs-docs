##### 3.2.2.4 Device Control
- Controls all system field elements to device sensor level for controllable sensors
- Each device control command checks current status of all closure devices in system and aborts if any closure control device status is unknown
- Each command (device sensor command, device command(macro), or system operational command(super macro) level) only executed when valid/good status exists for all device sensors
- Current status for all devices maintained at each controller unit

##### 3.2.2.5 Alarms
Check Device Status for Alarm Condition:
- Each status received from device sensors checked against alarm conditions for that device sensor, status updated to indicate alarm

Critical alarms generated when:
1. Closure device changes from known state to unknown state (status lost)
2. Closure device changes from legal state to illegal state (e.g., pop-ups in down position when supposed to be up)
3. Control system Integrity verification indicates verification failure
4. User logs in any of field units
5. Command to override device issued anywhere in system
6. Communication failure within RLCS network
7. Computer in RLCS network goes down
8. Power failure at any controller or workstation
9. Cabinet ID changed
10. DCUs in manual mode
11. Watch Dog timer failure

Warning alarms generated when:
1. Security sensor activation at either FCU or DCU
2. Air pressure, Temperature in cabinets, and Voltages outside limits of established thresholds as stored in database

If critical alarm occurs during opening/closing operation:
- System presents operator with possible actions to complete operation
- If overriding device status needed, system determines if operator has high enough security and provides advise on how to proceed

##### 3.2.2.6 Process GUI Commands
- In order for command to be processed from any workstation/controller, MCU field device must be in "Auto" mode
- System operator able to override any device and continue with system operational command sequence ('override' means setting status to normal value even if device not functioning)
- Process of overriding device status does not affect status of any other device
- Business Rules/Interlocks/Safety Screening: Each control command processed validated against secured safety rules (stored in non-volatile memory)
- Commands only forwarded from superior units to inferior ones (prevents lower level unit from changing state of device controlled by higher level/peer unit; TSU superior to FCUs which are superior to DCUs)

##### 3.2.2.7 Failed Requests
- If status from any device not received upon request, system automatically requests status again
- Failure to receive valid status after configurable number of retries considered device failure

##### 3.2.2.8 Identify and Initialize Devices
- When each workstation and control unit comes online, system identifies it and all associated device sensors
- RLCS software initializes each control unit and device sensor as identified
- RLCS software in field first identifies its unit when starts by reading cabinet id, then ensures all required cards present/working properly, does control system integrity check, initializes specified tables
- If everything OK startup process does not exceed 30 seconds
- RLCS software then monitors all devices and sends current status to FCU or TSU every 2 seconds (or rate specified in System Control Parameters for current mode)

##### 3.2.2.9 Future Changes
Designed to allow for future changes to roadway without requiring programming effort. Updating non-volatile memory-based tables sufficient to accommodate future changes (change in number of closure devices, entrances, changeable message signs, different closure devices, different operational procedures)

##### 3.2.2.10 Collect Log Data
Generates log files for reports:
- Device Command Log: Contains device commands issued with time stamp, operator ID, unit where command issued, includes failed/aborted commands (not editable by users)
- System Operation Command Log: Contains system operational commands issued with time stamp, operator ID, unit where command issued, includes failed/aborted commands (not editable by users)
- Problem Work Order Log: Generated automatically with failure information at time of failure, some input fields allow operator to input status and emergency notification information
- Alarm Log: Contains information about warning and critical alarm events
- Daily Diary Log: Generated automatically when user with Operator authority logs on to system, some input fields allow operator to input free form text information
- Special Event Log: Contains information about scheduled special events
- System Operation Schedule Log: Contains information about scheduled operations

#### 3.2.3 Sequencing
Executes stored operational control command sequences based on current system mode of operation and schedule for each sequence.

##### 3.2.3.1 Scheduled Operations
Executes stored operational control command sequences based on current system mode and schedule. Operational control command sequences to be stored/executed with initial configuration listed in Appendix F.

##### 3.2.3.2 Confirmation
Presents scheduled command operations to operator at GUI for confirmation prior to executing command.

##### 3.2.3.3 Halt Conditions
At any point in opening/closing sequence, sequence halted if:
- Device fails to report completion of current sequence step within response time window allotted for step
- Status of closure device previously opened at current entrance changes to 'unknown' or 'closed' without operator-initiated command
- Status of closure device previously closed at current entrance changes to 'unknown' or 'open' without operator-initiated command

##### 3.2.3.4 Opening Halt
At any point in opening sequence, sequence halted if status of closure device for opposite direction of travel changes to 'unknown' or 'open'.

##### 3.2.3.5 Resume Sequence
To resume opening/closing sequence after halt, operator able to issue command to resume if offending device status can be corrected within configurable time period as defined in database and non-volatile memory.

#### 3.2.4 Data Processing and Security
Stores, processes, and retrieves all data necessary to operate application software, generate current/historical reports of system operations, and export system status data to external server data store. Also stores, processes, and retrieves all data necessary to secure system from unauthorized use. Commercial off-the-shelf database management system used for this function.

##### 3.2.4.1 Database Operations
RLCS application software updates and reads database tables to support system operations.

##### 3.2.4.2 Encrypted Data
RLCS application software updates and reads password and device rule data in encrypted format.

##### 3.2.4.3 Security Information
Updates and reads security information. Personnel Security Level entity stores information about five attributes used to restrict access to RLCS: Command Level, Device, Mode, Workstation, and System Functions.

##### 3.2.4.4 Command Levels
Command levels of three types:
1. 'Status Only': Users may not issue any control commands at any level
2. 'Control': Allows user to issue control commands (higher level of security)
3. 'Override': Allows user to temporarily change status of device in database for configurable period to allow command sequence to continue

Commands classified in categories:
1. Device control commands: Single commands that change state of device
2. Device Macro Commands: Group of two or more sequentially executed commands that change states of two or more closure devices
3. Super Macro Commands: Group of two or more sequentially executed macros that change states of entrance
4. Override Commands: Commands that force status of device to temporary known state for purpose of completing operation
5. Device Status Commands: Commands that request status of device
6. Diagnostic Commands: Commands that run diagnostic on devices/controllers

##### 3.2.4.5 Data Integrity
System employs one-way hash function as aid to maintaining integrity of data/software in field. Hash value returned by function at least 128 bits in length (MD5 algorithm acceptable).

At each time one or more items listed under 'Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory' created/modified, UTC date/time stamp updated. Update of time stamp last step in process which builds time stamped code/data section.

System also produces table of returned 'one-way hash function' (Message Digest) values of each 'Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory' items. Returned 'Message Digest' values stored as hexadecimal characters. Appropriate 'Message Digest' table maintained in non-volatile memory in each system control unit.

System provides for periodic verification that current, recomputed 'Message Digest' values for each unit in system correspond with 'record' values computed by development process. Periodic evaluation occurs at least once a day. 'Message Digest' value verification results recorded in system log. Verification failure causes alarm condition for affected control unit. If failure occurs in checking non-volatile memory items, system prevents affected unit from being used in control sequences.

System provides for 'Message Digest' verification requests for given unit by operator command.

For system login purposes, hash function also used to encrypt user passwords.

To change device command rules on production system, System Administrator must upload new database version after testing rule changes in Simulator environment.
