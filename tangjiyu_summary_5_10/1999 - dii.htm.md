# Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE) - XML Services (XS) Software Requirements Specification

## System Overview
XML Services (XS) provide infrastructure services for mission and support applications using XML technology within the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE). These services isolate vendor-unique implementations of data access and provide applications a means of avoiding dependencies on physical access models.

## Functional Areas

### 1. Registration of Terms and Structures
Registration services for XML tags, Document Type Definitions (DTDs), and Document Content Descriptions (DCDs) to ensure semantic interoperability and prevent redundancy.

### 2. Design of XML Schemas
Services for creating and structuring XML document schemas with validation against standards and reuse of existing semantic structures.

### 3. Generation and Consumption of XML Documents
Capabilities for creating, validating, parsing, and rendering XML documents with schema compliance checking.

## Required States and Modes

### Operational Modes
- **Environmental Mode**: Real-time operations supporting crisis planning with heterogeneous data types and sources
- **COE Compliance**: Segmented services adhering to compliance level requirements
- **Fixed Mode**: Tunable data management services for base or data processing megacenters with varying workloads
- **Dynamic Mode**: Predetermined mission-focused operations for deployed units with limited administrative capabilities
- **Degraded Communications Mode**: Adjustable session time-out values based on network performance

### User Modes
- **End User Mode**: Services for data consumers, data/database managers, and network resource managers
- **Maintenance Mode**: Modification of application data segments, user permissions, privileges, and storage restructuring
- **Training Mode**: Production-environment processing via training applications rather than mission applications

## XML Services Capability Requirements

- Create naming structure within COE architecture expressing context and relationships
- Define metadata tags, meta-metadata, and related terms for maintenance and control
- Review and approve submissions
- Monitor changes to data models recorded in Registry

### 2. Design XML Document Schemas

#### Structure Services
- Record and validate schema structures against style guide standards
- Reuse and reference existing tags and semantic structures from Registry

#### Content Services
- Use and reference existing tags and semantic structures extracted from Registry
- Create new tags and associated semantic structures
- Interchange with other design tools and environments
- Record semantic structures in JTA-compliant formalism
- Generate standard views and version metadata objects

### 3. Generate XML and Schema Documents
- Create documents including schemas by reference or by value
- Develop dynamic cross-referencing and indexing of XML objects
- Generate language (natural language) and charset values
- Check conformance including well-formed validation and constraint validation
- Extract views of data and disassemble documents for different query results
- Render documents and interrogate content
- Transmit metadata to construct alternate semantically-valid views (e.g., XSL)
- Express version information

### 4. Consume XML and Schema Documents
- Provide parsers (DOM, SAX)
- Check conformance including well-formed validation and constraint validation
- Enable meaningful sharing of XML-based schemas and related information
- Extract semantically-valid views from XML documents (e.g., XSL)
- Disassemble hierarchical views to relational representations
- Render documents

## Interface Requirements

### External Interfaces
- Registry services provide standard APIs as specified in Appendix B
- External interfaces defined as connections to non-COE components

### Internal Interfaces
- Data access services provide standard APIs as specified in Appendix C
- Internal interfaces defined as connections to COE components:
  - Management Services API (Network, System, Security Administration)
  - Distributed System Services (Communications Services API)
  - Distribution and Object Management Services (Distributed Computing, Data Interchange)
  - Application Support Services (Presentation Services)
  - Common Support Applications (Office Automation, Message Processing, etc.)
  - Software Development Services (Developer's Toolkit)

### Data Interfaces
- Internal interface with existing data elements of DBIF, DAC, and COTS RDBMS products
- Interfaces to commercial products including Sybase, Oracle, and Informix

## Environmental Requirements
- Registry software shall be portable and execute on COE-compliant platforms
- Services shall operate in distributed computing environment with location transparency
- Support for remote data access (RDA) and distributed database management

## Metadata and Information Resource Management

### Information Resource Types
- XML_Element (tag, complex or terminal node)
- XML_Attribute (characteristic of element with possible enumeration constraints)
- Model (representation using formalism such as IDEF1x or Object Modeling)
- XML_Spec (DTD or DCD; schema for XML document)
- Domain (valid values for element or attribute)
- XML_Namespace (reference for uniqueness within Registry)
- Catalog (Registry conforming to explicit rules of engagement)
- Document (amplifying information such as readme.txt)

### Information Resource Status Levels
- Developmental
- Candidate
- Approved
- Rejected
- Retired

### Information Resource Association Types
- Uses/Used-by relationships
- Describes/Described-by relationships
- XML specification relationships
- Versioning relationships
- Domain constraint relationships
- Namespace relationships
- Element-attribute qualification relationships
- Model relationships

## Rules and Conventions

### Tag Creation Guidelines
- Use XML_Attributes sparingly; designate well-recognized terms as elements
- Include descriptive definitions and synonyms for Information Resource Definitions
- Support substring search capabilities in multiple fields including definitions

### Submission Procedures
1. Review existing tags in Registry and determine additions/modifications
2. Fill out XML submission document to package multiple tags
3. Specify relationships among tags, provide valid values, and add to submission package
4. Include amplifying information associated with specific tags
5. Submit package via email or FTP to designated point of contact

## Quality Attributes
- Portability across COE-compliant platforms
- Interoperability through standardized interfaces
- Semantic consistency through registry management
- Scalability supporting distributed operations
- Security through access control mechanisms
- Maintainability with version control and change management
- Reliability with error handling and recovery procedures
