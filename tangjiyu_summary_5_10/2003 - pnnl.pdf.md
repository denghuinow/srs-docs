# Task Report for the Energy Efficient and Affordable Small Commercial and Residential Buildings Research Program - Project 2.5 - Pattern-Recognition Based Fault Detection and Diagnostics - Automated Diagnostics Software Requirements Specification Version 1.1

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies requirements for a computerized automated diagnostic tool for detecting faults in HVAC system components. The tool detects and identifies faults in chillers and cooling tower subsystems using sensed data, unit specifications, installation/configuration data, and operation data.

### 1.2 Scope
The automated diagnostic tool focuses on diagnostics for chillers and cooling towers initially. It automates diagnostic processes previously performed through visual analysis of graphical data by human experts. The tool provides visual indication of faults, descriptive information about faults and their causes, and suggested corrective actions. It stores diagnostic results for subsequent retrieval and use.

### 1.3 Definitions
- Authenticate: Process by which tool establishes identity and privileges of user
- Component: Part that makes up software system
- Diagnostic result: Output of diagnostic processing - identified fault condition or confirmation of absence of fault
- Fixed data: Data describing unit characteristics that don't change regularly (specifications, design info, set points, installation data, operation data)
- Sensed data: Data measured through electronic/mechanical detection (temperatures, pressures, electrical current, machine state)
- Unit: Complete HVAC system
- Subsystem: Discrete part of HVAC system (e.g., chiller or cooling tower)

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Framework implemented in Java providing reusability of agent's communication. Provides basic building blocks for building agents, conversations between agents, and messages passed in conversations. Replaces current manual diagnostic process with automated one based on algorithms derived from expert practices.

### 2.2 Product Functions
1. Input sensed data in real time from data acquisition devices and HVAC unit
2. Input sensed data from electronic files (ASCII text files with specific format)
3. Input fixed data provided by user
4. Store sensed and fixed data to permanent storage
5. Validate sensed data with respect to expected range of values
6. Detect and identify faults in chiller and cooling tower subsystems
7. Display and record diagnostic results in simple graphical and textual format
8. Save diagnostic results to permanent storage for subsequent retrieval

### 2.3 User and Environment Characteristics
Users include service technicians, energy service providers, building operators, and building operator supervisors. Platforms could include portable computers, handheld devices, and personal workstations. Communication methods include wireless interfaces, direct connections, or network connections. Platform operating systems restricted to Microsoft Windows-compatible systems.

### 2.4 General Constraints
1. Support wide variety of users with respect to computer expertise
2. Provide capability to manually input and edit "fixed" data
3. Capability to configure tool for continuous diagnostic analysis over indefinite period
4. Tool will not provide capability for additional user-defined analysis of diagnostic results
5. Tool will be capable of obtaining sensed data from variety of sources
6. Current version includes diagnostic algorithms for cooling tower and chiller subsystems
7. Tool restricted to Microsoft Windows-compatible operating systems

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Use Cases
1. Start and Stop Diagnostics: Administrator user activates and ceases diagnostic processing
2. Browse Current Diagnostics: User views current diagnostic results
3. Browse Historical Diagnostics: User views historical diagnostic results
4. Configure Diagnostics: Administrator user adjusts diagnostic parameters
5. Authenticate User: Process by which user establishes privileges

### 3.2 Functionality

#### 3.2.1 General
Users classified into two types: general user (limited capabilities) and administrator (all general user privileges plus configuration capabilities).

#### 3.2.2 Preprocessing
1. Input sensed data in real time from data acquisition devices
2. Permit sensed data input from electronic file (ASCII text file with tab/comma delimiters)
3. Qualify sensed data as to certitude during acquisition process
4. Deem sensed data in doubt if acquisition not possible for default number of successive samples
5. Save sensed data used in/supporting diagnostic analyses to permanent storage
6. Indicate occurrence of missing data in permanent storage with unique placeholder
7. Store sensed data input to tool to permanent storage with precision of three significant figures
8. Validate sensed data with respect to expected range of values
9. Associate with each continuous parameter one or more tolerances for different sensitivity levels

#### 3.2.3 Diagnostic Process
1. Monitor performance and operational parameters for chillers and cooling towers
2. Identify specific faults in fault categories (chilled water supply temperature maintenance, chiller schedule, compressor cycling, compressor/condenser fan interlock, compressor/condenser pump interlock, cooling tower fan cycling, sump temperature control, cooling tower approach, cooling tower fan staging, cooling tower range, supply fans/CHW pumps interlock, etc.)
3. Associate text with each fault describing problem, causes, and recommended fix
4. Design tool to permit addition of diagnostic algorithms for other subsystems
5. Diagnostic algorithm shall not process if any input data missing
6. Monitor unit under diagnosis for indefinite period or until input data no longer available
7. Log diagnostic results as determined
8. Administrator shall have capability to adjust sensitivity of diagnostic analysis

#### 3.2.4 Output Processing
1. Administrator shall have ability to specify which diagnostic results will not be reported
2. Display of each diagnostic result for fault conditions includes description of fault, potential causes, location of fault, and absolute time of occurrence

### 3.5 Interfaces

#### 3.5.1 User Interfaces
1. User interface consists of six windows: Main, configuration, subsystems, condition, diagnostic information, and diagnostic history
2. Windows organized in hierarchy enforcing navigational order
3. Main window lists buildings monitored and summarizes current diagnostic status
4. Configuration window permits administrator to modify parameters (password, screen saver toggle, window position, buildings/subsystems monitored, enabled state of conditions, sensitivity, scale factors, expected range)
5. Subsystems window lists subsystems monitored for specific building and summarizes diagnostic status
6. Condition window lists current status of all diagnostics for specific subsystem
7. Diagnostic information window provides detailed description of diagnostic with problem description, causes, and fixes
8. Diagnostic history window displays historical diagnostic results with color map indication
