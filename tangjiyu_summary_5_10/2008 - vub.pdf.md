# Software Requirements Specification for Publications Management System (PMS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document presents an overall description and listing of functionality for a Publications Management System (PMS).

- Manual correction of retrieved information when incorrect or insufficient
- Explicit author management (name, first name, institute)
- Manual indication that references like 'D. Vermeir' and 'Dirk Vermeir' refer to same author
- Bulk update functionality
- Multiple access types including content access and access control
