# HATS Graphical User Interface - Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose and Intended Audience
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to clearly and precisely describe the requirements of the HATS-GUI (High Assurance Transformation System Graphical User Interface). The HATS-GUI is a platform-independent GUI for the High Assurance Transformation System (HATS). This document serves as a reference guide for software design, implementation, and maintenance.

### 1.2 Scope of Product
HATS was developed to explore transformation-based software development. The HATS-GUI provides users with an intuitive graphical interface to the HATS system, facilitating the creation, storage, retrieval, and modification of application files, parsing and execution of transformation language programs, and display of transformation outputs in the form of Syntax Derivation Trees (SDTs) and pretty-printed text.

## 2. General Description
### 2.1 Product Features
The HATS-GUI provides users with the ability to:
- Management of applications
- Parsing of transformation language programs and target programs
- Execution of transformation language programs
- Examination of SDT and pretty-printed output from transformations

### 2.2 Use Cases
Key use cases include:
1. Parse transformation language programs or target files
2. Execute transformation language programs
3. Select applications and files
4. Prepare applications (create, close, save, edit)
5. Configure applications (editors, SDT display, file associations)
6. Display SDT transformation output with manipulation capabilities
7. Display pretty-printed text transformation output
8. Generate pretty-printed output

## 3. Specific Requirements
### 3.1 External Interface Requirements
#### 3.1.1 User Interfaces
- Menu-driven interface with File, Application, Configure, Run, and View menus
- File operations: Select, Edit, Save-as, Delete, Exit
- Application operations: Select, Close, Save, Save-as, Delete
- Configuration: Editors, Node Display, File Associations, HATS-SML settings
- Run operations: Generate Parser, Parse Target/Program, Execute Transforms, Pretty-Print
- View operations: SDT, Text, Standard error/output, Select/Copy Text

#### 3.1.3 Software Interfaces
- Interface with HATS-SML (version 2.0) for parsing and executing transformation programs
- Communication with Host OS for file operations and process management

### 3.2 Behavioral Requirements
#### 3.2.2 Stimulus/Response
Menu Item Functions:
- File Menu: Select files, save as, delete, edit files, exit application
- Application Menu: Select/close applications, save configurations
- Configure Menu: Configure editors, node display, file associations, HATS-SML
- Run Menu: Generate parser, parse targets/programs, execute transforms, pretty-print
- View Menu: Display SDTs, text outputs, standard error/output

#### 3.2.3 Related Features
Parse/Execute Transformation:
1. Confirm transformation language program exists
2. Check parser file is younger than grammar and lexical specification files
3. Check parsed version of transformation language program exists and is current
4. Start FindTarget program using transformation language program as input
5. Check parsed versions of target programs exist and are current
6. Start ApplyTransformation program with parsed program and library files

Display Transformation Output:
- SDT display with navigation window for large trees
- Text display corresponding to leaf nodes of SDT
- Node selection and manipulation (expand, collapse, hide)
- Search capabilities for both SDTs and pretty-printed text
- Synchronized navigation between SDT and pretty-printed text displays

### 3.3 Non-Behavioral Requirements
#### 3.3.2 Qualitative Requirements
- Portability: GUI shall run on Windows 2000, Sun Solaris 8, and Linux without modification
- Security: No login or authentication required

#### 3.3.3 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Implementation in Java 1.3 programming language
- Avoid memory-intensive SDT display algorithms

## 4. Appendices
### Appendix D: HATS-SML Communication Protocol
HATS-SML programs invoked with command line arguments:
- MakeParser: Generates parser for transformation language programs
- ParseTarget: Generates parsed target file from target-parser file and target
- ParseTLP: Generates parsed transformation language program file
- FindTargets: Generate list of target files used as inputs for transformation program
- ApplyTransformations: Executes transformation language program
- PrettyPrint: Generates formatted output file from SDT

### Appendix E: SDT Search Criteria
SDT searching performed on tokenized strings with facilities for "first match", "next match", etc. Search pattern is a string that is a sub-string of a string derived from some non-terminal in the target grammar.

### Appendix F: Text Search Criteria
Text searching applies to pretty-printed text and SDT text windows. Search string is sequence of characters including special characters $, *, [, ], \, and ^ with specific interpretations.
