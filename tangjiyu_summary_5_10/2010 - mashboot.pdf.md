# Software Requirements Specification for Mashbot

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document is the general overview of the software requirements for the Mashbot project. These requirements are directly related to the functionality, performances, constraints, attributes, and interfaces of the system.

Mashbot is a web service for managing a company's presence on social networks. One goal of Mashbot is to unify the interfaces of a multitude of social networks, allowing users to learn a standardized interface and more easily cope with the flood of new social network platforms. A second goal is to allow for a hands off approach to social network marketing by allowing the scheduling of campaign events to be distributed to social networks.

### 1.2 Scope
This document contains the criteria by which the initial Mashbot release will be judged. It is written for the developers, testers, and end-users of Mashbot.

### 1.3 Glossary
- Campaign: A collection of content that is scheduled to be published
- External Service Account: An account on a social networking platform outside of Mashbot

### 1.4 Overview
Marketing, customer service, business overhead and development efforts compete for resources in many startups and small businesses. Furthermore, early stage startups often have small or non-existent marketing budgets, especially in resource-hungry product-based startups. Although the plethora of widely available and affordable communications technology (e.g., social media, VoIP, streaming video, etc.) theoretically reduces both capital and operating expenditures related to marketing, the quantity of such technologies and services effectively creates an "opportunity overload" which makes the process of maintaining a focused and effective marketing campaign more difficult. Furthermore, with the number of services, technologies, and "specialists" arriving each day, it is nearly impossible to keep up with all the trends, much less fully take advantage of each one, or even monitor them all adequately. The widespread adoption of communications technology is a double-edged sword; there are many more avenues for marketing and customer service, but it is much more difficult to effectively apply reputation management strategies or adequate customer service through all channels. This project proposes to build a tool to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing campaigns and customer service for small to medium businesses.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The initial focus will be on scheduled marketing campaigns utilizing social media. However, this may expand to include customer service functionality, management of more traditional campaigns such as direct mail, trade shows and other events, or user-created campaign classes.

The first objective is to develop and release a small open source platform to provide a service agnostic facade API bundling common operations in widely used services (e.g., Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, Wordpress, or YouTube). This platform will provide a plugin-based architecture for abstracting myriad services behind a single facade, based upon content types provided in common data models. This sub-project will not only be useful to the open source community but will also devalue much of the competition whose prime added value comes from providing such a service. Furthermore, it opens the opportunity for the public to help maintain existing service plugins as well as contribute plugins for new services. Finally, it leads to the inclusion of both a dual licensing revenue model and a niche software development service-based revenue model for custom extensions and applications built upon this core, which is proven to be more sustainable over time.

The first application of this core platform will be the campaign manager referenced above. While the exact feature set is to be determined during the design process, expected features include a portal to existing services where messages can be "pushed", or broadcast, through existing service channels. This portal will also allow for the collection of responses from customers, fans, critics, and other audiences from these same channels. Users will be able to view social networking messages directed at them, as well as perform data mining tasks on the social networks to provide more intelligent heuristics regarding brands' strength amongst particular markets. They will also be allowed to schedule campaign events at certain times. For example, users will be able to prepare a press release far in advance of its distribution, or queue a number of updates to be spread out over a certain time period.

#### 2.1.1 System Interfaces
Mashbot combines several components to provide required functionality:
- Authentication: Mashbot will allow the use of external authentication modules for user login. Mashbot will also provide an internal authentication mechanism in case an external module is unavailable.
- Campaign Manager Web Client: Mashbot has an interface for a web client which processes user commands to interact with campaigns.
- Publishing and Aggregation Platform: Mashbot has an interface for publishing content to social networks, as well as for aggregating social network data.
- Database: Mashbot has an interface to a database which allows for the storage and retrieval of data related to accounts and campaigns.

#### 2.1.2 User Interface
The user interface consists of a web front end with tabs to separate the various workflow areas. To create content, the user is provided with a calendar scheduling tool and a content editor. Additionally, there is a monitoring dashboard which gives the user a view on responses to the content in any given campaign. Finally, there is an explore view that gives the user a portal with which they can keep tabs on topics of interest in social media.

#### 2.1.3 Hardware Interfaces
The Mashbot web client runs on any computer hardware meeting the following criteria:
- Capable of connecting to the Internet
- Capable of running a modern HTTP 1.1 web browser
- Includes a keyboard and a pointing device
- Includes writable volatile storage

The Mashbot server runs on any computer hardware meeting the following criteria:
- Capable of connecting to the Internet as a server.
- Capable of interfacing with modern database software.
- Capable of running a modern suite of networking software.

#### 2.1.4 Software Interfaces
The Mashbot software integrates some external software to provide functionality:
- Authentication: Mashbot authenticates users against it's internal user database.
- Campaign Manager Web Client: Mashbot interfaces with the users web browser and expects that it is capable of HTTP 1.1 and HTML 4.0.
- Database: Mashbot software interfaces with an existing database software.
- Publishing and Aggregation Platform
- Server: The Mashbot server runs on an operating system that supports serving dynamic web pages using encryption and is capable of communicating with the Internet.

#### 2.1.5 Communications Interfaces
Communication between the web client and the server software is facilitated by common network protocols. This allows compatibility with the majority of our user's machines. Data will be encrypted using TLS and HTTP/1.1. The use of these protocols requires the ability for the systems to communicate using TCP/IP network stacks. The Mashbot system sends emails using SMTP.

#### 2.1.6 Memory Constraints
The Mashbot server requires no greater than 1 gigabyte of RAM memory. The web client requires no more than the minimum memory a modern desktop computer commonly has, approximately 256 megabytes of RAM.

### 2.2 Product Functions
Mashbot should be able to:
1. Schedule content for various services to be published concurrently
2. View and Compare historical metrics of campaigns
3. View/Create replies to content
4. Maintain users and approvers of content
5. Set up keyword alerts for "watched" services

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The target user is a small to medium business employee who understands the basic capabilities of social media.

### 2.4 Requirements Apportioning
Priority Description:
- Priority 1: Mashbot can not be released unless it satisfies these requirements.
- Priority 2: Mashbot may be initially released without satisfying these requirements. Having these requirements unfulfilled must not create dangers to the system. They should be implemented in the next minor release.
- Priority 3: These requirements are not expected to be fulfilled by the initial release of Mashbot, but should be implemented in the next major release.
- Priority 4: These requirements are outside the current scope of the project, but are included to exhibit how our software will improve in the future.

## 4. User Interface
The user interface will consist of a tabbed navigation bar that unifies the sitewide navigation, as well as module specific navigation as needed. Tabs:
- Dashboard
- Create
- Schedule
- Explore

### 4.1 Dashboard
The dashboard consists of graphs and charts to give the user a quick view on how their campaigns are performing. Metrics include:
- Clickthrough rate
- Page Views
- Number of Comments
Service plugins can define additional specialized metrics to track, as well, for instance "retweets" for Twitter.

A panel is available to give more information on each metric as it is selected.

#### 4.1.1 Create
This view allows users to create campaigns and fill them with content. This view is also used when users need to edit an existing campaign.

Add content: A user can add content via the add content button near the top of the view. This will prompt the user to select the content type, which is populated by the services the user currently has access to via credentials stored in the system. This will create a section in the main part of the view that allows the user to add individual elements of that content type, each individually scheduled. Each row line item will allow the user to schedule, edit, or delete that content type.

#### 4.1.2 Schedule
Scheduling content: Users can drag items from the left hand bucket of content to the calendar to schedule content. The content will receive a default golive time of 12am on the day the content is dragged to. If the user desires a different time, he may click the content in the schedule and assign the proper time.

Calendar: The calendar allows the user to manage when content goes live, and gives a visual representation of the actions taken on content. It is clear when content goes live and when (if) it is deleted. The user can page from month to month to schedule content to any day desired.

#### 4.1.3 Explore
This view allows users to get a pulse on what information social media contains. This includes the ability to set up monitored searches for services that support keyword search via api. This also will aggregate data gathered from comments on content that has been published as part of a given campaign.

## 5. Preliminary Analysis
Mashbot is a data driven web application. It aggregates data from various web services. This figure shows the flow of data through the web application. There is a core that handles all requests for various data needed by the application. Authentication information is retrieved from the database and used to request content from services.
