# Michigan Department of Transportation VII Data Use Analysis and Processing System Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
This requirements specification provides a repository for the requirements governing the design of MDOT's VII DUAP System. These requirements form the basis for the design verification and validation of each version of the system.

### 1.2 System Scope
The DUAP project investigates and evaluates the utility of VII data and its integration with other transportation agency sources in enhancing safety, increasing mobility, and improving asset management. Tasks include identifying uses for VII data, developing algorithms to use and process the VII data, developing prototype applications and data management software, and evaluating the utility of the processed data for MDOT and its partners.

## 2. General Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
DUAP is a research program to determine how new VII data impacts safety, traffic operations and management, asset management, winter operations, and transportation planning. The program focuses on demonstration and assessment of data transformation and management.

The DUAP system has four high-level capabilities:
- Collecting data
- Consolidating the collected information
- Converting data into information needed by transportation agencies
- Communicating the unified information to various agencies and the public

### 2.2 Product Functions
The DUAP system is represented as a set of services:
- Input services
- Dynamic data services
- Computational services
- Persistent data services
- Output services
- Presentation services
- Administrative services

### 2.3 User Characteristics
Users include MDOT organizational units, transportation agency operators, maintainers, asset managers, system administrators, management, contractors, travelers, emergency services, researchers, university personnel, and the Michigan Transportation Research Board.
