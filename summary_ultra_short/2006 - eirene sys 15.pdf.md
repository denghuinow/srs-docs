# Ultra Short Summary
- The EIRENE system is a GSM-based digital radio standard for European railways to ensure interoperability and support operational, safety, and administrative communications.

**MVP Points**
- Support GSM teleservices including telephony, emergency calls, and voice group/broadcast services.
- Implement functional numbering to address users by role rather than equipment number.
- Provide location-dependent addressing for routing calls based on train location.
- Enable railway emergency calls with high priority and automatic confirmation.

**Key Constraints**
- Operate in the Railway GSM (R-GSM) frequency band (876–915 MHz uplink / 921–960 MHz downlink).
- Ensure 95% coverage probability with specified field strength levels for voice and safety-critical data.
- Use standardized GSM services and protocols, with mandatory support for VGCS/VBS and eMLPP.

**Major Risks/Undecided Issues**
- Not mentioned.
