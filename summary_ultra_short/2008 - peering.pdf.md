# Ultra Short Summary
This software enables distinct Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to coordinate and cooperate through peering for scalable, reliable content delivery.

- **MVP points**
  - Web servers detect hotspots and initiate peering requests under exceptional load.
  - Mediators generate service requirements and negotiate relationships with other CDNs.
  - Peering Agents discover external resources and establish peering arrangements.
  - Operational management ensures content delivery, request redirection, and policy enforcement.

- **Key constraints**
  - Limited information sharing due to proprietary CDN operations complicates request-redirection.
  - Implementation relies on heuristics for dynamic attributes like server load and network delay.
  - The system must virtualize multiple providers while preserving individual SLA commitments.

- **Major risks/undecided issues**
