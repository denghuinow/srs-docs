# Ultra Short Summary
- This document specifies requirements for an automated diagnostic tool that detects and identifies operational faults in HVAC subsystems (chillers, cooling towers, boilers) using sensed and fixed data to assist building operators and service technicians.

**MVP Points**
- The tool shall detect and identify specific performance and operational faults in chiller and cooling tower subsystems.
- The tool shall display diagnostic results with fault descriptions, causes, and recommended fixes.
- The tool shall support real-time and batch-mode input of sensed data from acquisition devices or files.
- The tool shall store diagnostic results and associated metadata for historical review.

**Key Constraints**
- The tool is restricted to Microsoft Windows-compatible operating systems.
- The initial version focuses on diagnostics for chillers and cooling towers only.
- Users are classified into general users and administrators with different privileges.

**Major Risks/Undecided Issues**
- Not mentioned.
