# Ultra Short Summary

The X-38 Fault Tolerant System Services (FTSS) provides a fault-tolerant software layer for the quad-redundant Flight Critical Computer, enabling Byzantine-resilient operation and interfacing between NASA's application code and the underlying hardware/operating system.

**MVP Points**
- FTSS shall provide scheduling services with 50 Hz, 10 Hz, and 1 Hz rate groups to execute application tasks in a deterministic manner.
- FTSS shall implement fault detection, isolation, and redundancy management to maintain system operation through two non-simultaneous hardware faults.
- FTSS shall provide synchronous and immediate message-passing communication services between virtual groups using the Network Element hardware.
- FTSS shall perform system initialization, including Built-In Tests and synchronization of FCP processors, within 1.5 minutes from power-on.

**Key Constraints**
- FTSS and the VxWorks operating system together shall utilize no more than 3 MB of ROM and 9 MB of DRAM.
- FTSS shall be written in C and operate on the Radstone PowerPC 604R using VxWorks version 5.4.
- FTSS shall deliver all Draper-provided telemetry data within an allocated budget of 5000 bits per second.

**Major Risks/Undecided Issues**
- Not mentioned.
