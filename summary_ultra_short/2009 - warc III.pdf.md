# Ultra Short Summary
- This project extends the WARC Tools suite to provide enhanced tools and a full migration application for converting and managing web archives in the WARC format.

**MVP points**
- Build a migration application to convert ARC files to WARC format with validation and workflow management.
- Develop a repackaging tool to filter and extract records from WARC files into new WARC files.
- Create a reporting application to generate summaries and reports from WARC file collections.
- Implement a quality assurance tool to compare WARC file sets and identify differences between crawls.

**Key constraints**
- The tools must be able to process large collections of WARC files using distributed processing.
- The implementation must avoid unnecessary technology dependencies and partner-specific integrations.
- The tools must be compliant with Java development environments and provide logging and usability features.

**Major risks/undecided issues**
