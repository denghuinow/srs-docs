# Ultra Short Summary
- The I-15 Reversible Lane Control System (RLCS) application software will replace the existing system to safely open and close reversible lanes for peak traffic and special events.

**MVP Points**
- The system shall provide a graphical user interface for operators to view system status and issue commands.
- The system shall execute stored operational control command sequences for opening and closing lanes.
- The system shall monitor all field device sensors and process operator requests for changing device status.
- The system shall store, process, and retrieve all data necessary to operate the application and generate reports.

**Key Constraints**
- The RLCS application must be available 24/7 with 99.99% uptime and a recovery time of no more than 10 minutes.
- The system must use commercial off-the-shelf software for data processing, security, and reporting functions.
- The application software processing code and data at field controllers must reside in non-volatile memory.

**Major Risks/Undecided Issues**
- A catastrophic risk exists if the system allows entrances to be opened in opposite directions simultaneously.
- Not mentioned.
