# Ultra Short Summary
THEMAS is an independent energy management system that monitors and controls building heating and cooling units based on thermostat readings.

**MVP points**
- Monitor temperature from thermostats and determine when heating/cooling is needed
- Control heating/cooling units with limits on simultaneous operation
- Generate alarms for invalid temperatures and temperature limit violations
- Provide operational reports and event logging

**Key constraints**
- Must run on Microsoft Windows NT operating system
- Heating/cooling units provide no feedback on signal realization
- Thermostats only provide temperature values and settings

**Major risks/undecided issues**
- Interface to control heating/cooling units is not yet defined
- Not mentioned
