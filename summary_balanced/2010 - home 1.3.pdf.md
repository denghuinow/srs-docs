# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
The DigitalHome system is a smart home management prototype allowing users to monitor and control home environmental systems via web interfaces. The scope is limited to temperature, humidity, security, and appliance management in a simulated environment for business decision-making purposes. This initial version serves as a proof-of-concept prototype rather than a complete commercial product.

## Roles and User Stories
- **General User**: As a general user, I want to monitor home temperature and humidity so that I can maintain comfortable living conditions.
- **General User**: As a general user, I want to control appliance power states so that I can manage energy usage and convenience.
- **General User**: As a general user, I want to view monthly environmental reports so that I can analyze historical home management data.
- **Master User**: As a master user, I want to modify system configuration so that I can adapt the system to changing household needs.
- **DH Technician**: As a DH technician, I want to set up user accounts and system parameters so that I can properly configure the DigitalHome system.

## Key Processes
1. **Trigger: User login** → User authenticates via web interface to access DH controls
2. System reads sensor values (temperature, humidity, security contacts, power states)
3. User views current environmental conditions and device statuses
4. User modifies controller setpoints or appliance power states
5. System transmits control signals to appropriate devices via wireless gateway
6. System logs all sensor readings and user actions for reporting
7. **Trigger: End of day** → System performs daily backup of all configuration and usage data

## Domain Data Elements
- **User Account** (PK: UserID): Username, Password, Role, ContactInfo, AccessRights
- **Thermostat** (PK: DeviceID): Location, CurrentTemp, SetPoint, Schedule, Status
- **Humidistat** (PK: DeviceID): Location, CurrentHumidity, SetPoint, Schedule, Status
- **Security Sensor** (PK: SensorID): Location, SensorType, CurrentState, AlarmStatus, LastTriggered
- **Power Switch** (PK: SwitchID): ConnectedAppliance, CurrentState, Schedule, Location, PowerRating
- **Monthly Plan** (PK: PlanID): MonthYear, TemperatureSettings, HumiditySettings, SecuritySettings, ApplianceSchedules

## Non-Functional Requirements
- System reliability of no more than 1 failure per 10,000 operation hours
- Environmental display updates at least every 2 seconds
- Wireless communication range of 1000 feet for indoor transmission
- Daily automated backup of all system data and configuration
- User authentication via account name and password with data encryption
- Sensor data acquisition rate minimum of 10 Hz

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- Requirements completion by October 27, 2010
- Architecture design completion by November 15, 2010
- Six construction cycles from December 2010 through May 2011
- System testing completion by June 20, 2011
- Acceptance testing completion by July 14, 2011

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Risk**: Tight 12-month development schedule → **Mitigation**: Use iterative development with six construction cycles
- **Risk**: Cost constraints for competitive positioning → **Mitigation**: Conduct price comparisons and minimize element costs
- **Risk**: System reliability affecting user safety → **Mitigation**: Implement robust exception handling and backup mechanisms
- **Risk**: Integration with various HVAC systems → **Mitigation**: Adhere to ASHRAE standards and compatibility requirements
- **Risk**: Wireless communication limitations → **Mitigation**: Ensure 1000-foot indoor range specification and reliable transmission

## Undecided Issues
- Specific commercial product features beyond prototype scope
- Exact pricing model for future commercial versions
- Long-term hardware supplier partnerships
- Detailed expansion plans for additional smart home features
- Specific marketing and distribution channels
- Final user interface design aesthetics and branding
