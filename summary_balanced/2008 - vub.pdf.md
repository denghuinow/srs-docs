# Balanced Summary

## Goals and Scope
The Publications Management System (PMS) manages a database with bibliographical information and full-text publications in PDF and PostScript formats. It supports automatic extraction of bibliographic data from publications and provides web/command-line interfaces following W3C XHTML standards. The system enables access control, bulk updates, and cross-referencing of authors and institutions.

## Roles and User Stories
- **Guest**: I want to register for an account so that I can access system features
- **VUB-Network User**: I want to search for publications so that I can find relevant research
- **Member**: I want to download publications so that I can access full-text content
- **Publisher**: I want to upload publications so that I can share my research
- **Administrator**: I want to manage user accounts so that I can maintain system security

## Key Processes
1. **User Registration** (triggered by guest accessing system)
2. **Publication Search** (triggered by user entering search criteria)
3. **Publication Upload** (triggered by publisher submitting documents)
4. **Access Control** (triggered by user authentication attempts)
5. **Data Extraction** (triggered by publication upload)
6. **Export Operations** (triggered by user requesting downloads)
7. **System Administration** (triggered by administrator actions)

## Domain Data Elements
- **User**: (user_id) - username, password, email, role, department
- **Publication**: (publication_id) - title, authors, publication_date, abstract, file_format
- **Author**: (author_id) - first_name, last_name, institute, aliases
- **Group**: (group_id) - group_name, permissions, department
- **Reference**: (reference_id) - citation_text, format, publication_id
- **Search**: (search_id) - criteria, results, timestamp

## Non-functional Requirements
- System must comply with W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard
- Password encryption for transmission and storage
- Modular design for future expansions
- Linux compatibility (Wilma server)
- Object-oriented implementation using Ruby
- Database consistency and backup capabilities

## Milestones and External Dependencies
- First iteration with basic functions
- Second iteration with enhanced features
- Dependencies: Ruby 1.8+, MySQL database, Linux environment
- Wilma server availability
- W3C XHTML compliant browsers

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- Database corruption risk mitigated by regular backups
- Security breaches mitigated by password encryption and access controls
- System downtime risk mitigated by error handling and maintenance procedures
- Data inconsistency risk mitigated by validation processes
- Performance issues mitigated by modular design

## Undecided Issues
- Maximum file size for publications (Not mentioned)
- Additional supported formats beyond PDF/PS (Not mentioned)
- Automatic author/institution recognition implementation (Not mentioned)
- Audio/video file support (Not mentioned)
- Specific performance requirements (Not mentioned)
- Complete installation procedure details (Not mentioned)
