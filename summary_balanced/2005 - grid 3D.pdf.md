# Balanced Summary

**Goals and scope**
The Grid 3D Application enables researchers to visualize and investigate biological data in a three-dimensional environment. It allows users to see differences in data attributes at a glance and provides capabilities for detailed point examination. The tool addresses a gap in available visualization solutions for scientific research.

**Roles and user stories**
- As an Identifier, I want to select multiple data points so that I can compare their names simultaneously
- As an Investigator, I want to double-click data points so that I can view detailed information
- As a Demonstrator, I want to rotate and zoom the 3D grid so that I can present data from different perspectives
- As a Research Scientist, I want to load formatted biological data files so that I can visualize my research data
- As a User, I want the application to color points by cluster so that I can quickly identify patterns

**Key processes**
1. User supplies formatted biological data file (trigger: application start)
2. System plots up to 2000 data points in 3D space with cluster-based coloring
3. User interacts with grid through rotation, zoom, and movement controls
4. User selects points through mouse clicks to retrieve information
5. System displays point names on single click
6. System shows detailed point information on double click
7. Application maintains orientation changes in real-time

**Domain data elements**
- Data Point (primary key: Name; fields: X_Value, Y_Value, Z_Value, Cluster_Number, Description)
- Grid Configuration (primary key: SessionID; fields: X_Axis_Label, Y_Axis_Label, Z_Axis_Label, Background_Color, Point_Size)
- User Session (primary key: SessionID; fields: User_Type, Data_File, Current_Orientation, Selected_Points)

**Non-functional requirements**
- Must run on both Windows and Linux operating systems
- Application must start within 30 seconds
- Point interaction response time under 2 seconds
- Support for up to 2000 data points
- Intuitive interface requiring no specialist training
- Clear black-on-white coloring for printable screenshots

**Milestones and external dependencies**
- Required for inclusion in scientific paper by March 2005
- Dependency on Java-enabled internet browsers
- Integration with Tomcat/Apache/Ant for deployment
- Compatibility with Matlab for data pre-processing
- Support for Windows 98/2000/NT/XP and Linux/Solaris

**Risks and mitigation strategies**
- Tight development timeline risk - mitigate through focused scope and prioritized features
- Cross-platform compatibility issues - mitigate through early testing on target environments
- Performance with maximum data points - mitigate through optimization and load testing
- User adoption of data formatting requirements - mitigate through clear documentation

**Undecided issues**
- Specific data file formatting specifications
- Detailed color scheme implementation
- Exact point sizing parameters
- Server-side execution architecture details
- Browser compatibility specifics
- Not mentioned
