# Balanced Summary

**Goals and scope**
GOG is a software simulator designed to generate Gaia mission data including catalog, main database, and statistically equivalent final mission data without requiring actual telemetry or database systems. It uses universe and spacecraft models with error models to rapidly simulate large datasets for all Gaia instruments. The system provides modular, configurable simulations through input configuration files with user-selectable noise effects and output formats.

**Roles and user stories**
- As a data processor, I want to generate catalog data from universe models so that I can test processing pipelines
- As a calibration developer, I want to simulate data with selectable calibration errors so that I can validate calibration algorithms
- As a scientist, I want to generate data for specific sky regions so that I can analyze particular astronomical phenomena
- As a system tester, I want to produce main database equivalent data so that I can verify system integration
- As a cluster operator, I want to run GOG in grid environments so that I can process large datasets efficiently

**Key processes**
1. System initialization triggered by configuration file input
2. Source generation from universe model or input catalog
3. Epoch parameter calculation for individual transits
4. Combined parameter computation across multiple transits
5. Spectrum simulation for RP/BP and RVS instruments
6. Noise model application (user-selectable)
7. Output generation in specified database formats

**Domain data elements**
- Source (source_id, position, magnitude, spectral_type, physical_parameters)
- Transit (transit_id, timestamp, field_angles, magnitude_measurements)
- Spectrum (spectrum_id, wavelength_range, flux_data, noise_characteristics)
- Configuration (config_id, input_source, noise_settings, output_specification)
- ErrorModel (model_id, error_type, parameters, application_conditions)
- OutputData (output_id, data_type, format_specification, quality_flags)

**Non-functional requirements**
- Platform independence (Linux, UNIX, MAC)
- Processing performance of 2 CPU seconds per source
- Cluster/grid environment compatibility
- Command-line and script execution capability
- Consistent results for identical input configurations
- Support for significant dataset sizes (up to 20% of final catalog)

**Milestones and external dependencies**
- Integration with Gaia Simulator project and libraries
- Compliance with Main Database Interface Control Document
- Dependence on calibration error models from CUs
- Gradual implementation based on GIBIS study results
- Evolution based on error model availability

**Risks and mitigation strategies**
- Main database specifications incomplete - use current specifications with revision capability
- Error model availability uncertain - implement gradual model integration
- Processing performance requirements - optimize source-by-source processing
- Output format changes - design modular output system
- Complex noise modeling - provide user-selectable noise options

**Undecided issues**
- Detailed overlapping effects modeling timeline
- Final calibration error model specifications
- Complete main database content definition
- Specific cluster deployment requirements
- Detailed spectrum noise implementation
