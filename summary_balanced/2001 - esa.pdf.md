# Balanced Summary

**Goals and scope**
The APAF ground data system processes ASPERA-3 instrument telemetry and Mars Express orbit/attitude data into standardized IDFS datasets. It supports the science team during mission operations and archives validated data to NASA's Planetary Data System within six months of acquisition. The system also provides web-based data displays for both public outreach and scientific analysis.

**Roles and user stories**
- *Science Team Member*: I want to access processed IDFS data within 24 hours so that I can perform timely scientific analysis
- *Public User*: I want to view current instrument data displays so that I can monitor mission progress
- *System Operator*: I want automated telemetry processing so that daily data products are generated consistently
- *Data Archivist*: I want validated PDS-compliant datasets so that long-term preservation requirements are met
- *Co-Investigator*: I want password-protected science analysis displays so that proprietary data remains secure during validation periods

**Key processes**
1. System triggered by daily telemetry arrival acquires ASPERA-3 and orbit/attitude data from ESOC
2. Process raw telemetry into cleaned intermediate files when needed
3. Convert telemetry to standardized IDFS data sets for all instrument components
4. Distribute processed data to ASPERA-3 team members within 24 hours
5. Generate web displays for public viewing and science analysis
6. Archive all telemetry and processed data locally at SwRI
7. Submit calibrated data to NASA PDS within 6 months of acquisition

**Domain data elements**
- *Telemetry Data* (primary key: packet_id): source, timestamp, instrument_type, raw_data, quality_flag
- *IDFS Dataset* (primary key: dataset_id): virtual_instrument, processing_date, data_products, calibration_info, format_version
- *Orbit/Attitude Data* (primary key: orbit_number): position, orientation, time_range, spacecraft_parameters
- *Web Display* (primary key: display_id): data_source, visualization_type, access_level, update_frequency
- *Archive Record* (primary key: archive_id): storage_location, data_type, retention_period, backup_status
- *Processing Log* (primary key: log_id): process_name, execution_time, status, error_messages

**Non-functional requirements**
- System must operate on UNIX-based production and development computers
- Web server requires password protection for sensitive scientific data
- Network connection to NISN must be maintained for data transfers
- Built-in error handling for data integrity assurance
- Local archival system for data availability and reprocessing
- 24-hour distribution capability for Co-I data access

**Milestones and external dependencies**
- MEX launch scheduled for June 2003
- Dependency on ESOC for telemetry data delivery
- Interface compliance with ESA Mars Express SGICD
- PDS archive submission within 6-month deadline
- Software delivery to support instrument integration and testing

**Risks and mitigation strategies**
- Telemetry format changes: Maintain flexible processing algorithms and regular interface reviews
- Data delivery delays: Implement redundant distribution mechanisms and monitoring
- Archive storage capacity: Plan for scalable storage solutions and regular capacity assessments
- Validation timeline pressure: Develop automated calibration and validation procedures
- Team access issues: Establish clear distribution protocols in Operations Procedures Document

**Undecided issues**
- Final distribution mechanisms for Co-I data delivery
- Specific web display configurations for science analysis
- Detailed data set requirements for each Co-Investigator
- Installation-dependent adaptation requirements
